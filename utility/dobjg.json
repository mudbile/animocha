[{"﻿title":"は～だ","description":"Someone or something is/was someone or something or is/was in some state, or will do/does/did something.","englishEquivalent":"","textInfo":"1. The particle used with the noun or noun phrase between のは and だ usually drops if the particle does not have any concrete meaning (as in the cases of が and を), or if the meaning of the entire sentence is somehow predictable. Examples follow.  <ul>(1) <li>八時にうちに来たのは森田さん(*が)だ。</li> <li>It was Mr. Morita who came to my house at eight o'clock.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>森田さんが持って来たのはケーキ(*を)だ。</li> <li>It was cake that Mr. Morita brought here.</li> </ul>  <ul>(3) <li>森田さんがケーキをくれたのは弟(に)だ。</li> <li>It was to my brother that Mr. Morita gave cake.</li> </ul>  <ul>(4) <li>森田さんがうちに来たのは車でだ。</li> <li>It was by his car that Mr. Morita came to my house.</li> </ul>  <ul>(5) <li>a. 森田さんが来たのは東京からだ。</li> <li>It was from Tokyo that Mr. Morita came.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 森田さんが出発したのは東京(から)だ。</li> <li>It was from Tokyo that Mr. Morita departed.</li> </ul>  <ul>(6) <li>a. 森田さんが飲んだのは田山さんとだ。</li> <li>It was with Mr. Tayama that Mr. Morita drank.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 森田さんが一緒に飲んだのは田山さん(と)だ。</li> <li>It was with Mr. Tayama that Mr. Morita (literally: together drank.)</li> </ul>  In (5b) and (6b) the particles から and と normally drop, because 出発した 'departed' and 一緒に 'together' generally co-occur with から and と, respectively.  3. The element between のは and だ cannot be a manner adverb. The following sentences are all unacceptable.  <ul>(7) <li>*花子が歩いたのはゆっくりだ。</li> <li>*It was slowly that Hanako walked.</li> </ul>  <ul>(8) <li>*太郎が字を書いたのはきれいにだ。</li> <li>*It was beautifully that Taro wrote characters.</li> </ul>  Unlike English, the copula だ in this construction is normally in the present tense.  <ul>(9) <li>きのう買ったのはステレオです/???でした。</li> <li>It was a stereo set that I bought yesterday.</li> </ul>  5. The number of のは~だ sentences which can be produced from one sentence is limited only by the number of elements which can be placed between のは and だ. For example, four such sentences can be derived from (10).  <ul>(10) <li>ジョンがジェーンに東京で八月に会った。</li> <li>John met Jane in August in Tokyo.</li> </ul>  <ul>(11) <li>a. ジェーンに東京で八月に会ったのはジョンだ。</li> <li>It was John who met Jane in August in Tokyo.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ジョンが東京で八月に会ったのはジェーンだ。</li> <li>It was Jane whom John met in August in Tokyo.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. ジョンがジェーンに八月に会ったのは東京(で)だ。</li> <li>It was in Tokyo that John met Jane in August.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. ジョンがジェーンに東京で会ったのは八月だ。</li> <li>It was in August that John met Jane in Tokyo.</li> </ul>  6. Normally the の clause takes は, marking the entire clause as presupposed, old, unimportant information, and the element between のは and だ represents a new, important piece of information. But sometimes the の clause takes が, marking the clause as new, important information. In this case the element between のが and だ indicates unimportant information.  <ul>(12) <li>私が作っているのがロボットです。</li> <li>The one I'm making is a robot.</li> </ul>  <ul>[Correct phrase]  <li>ロボットは私が作っています。</li> <li>Speaking of robots, I'm making one.</li> </ul>  【Related Expression】  の in the present construction should not be confused with the の used as a nominalizer. Sentence [1] is the のは~だ construction and [2], the nominalized sentence.  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ の (3)\">の3</a>)  [1]  <ul> <li>本を読むのはたいてい夜だ。</li> <li>It is usually at night that I read books.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>本を読むのはいいことだ。</li> <li>It is a good thing to read books.</li> </ul>  One way to differentiate between the two constructions is to see if the sentence can be restated by deleting のは and だ and placing the element before のは in an appropriate position. For example, [1] can be restated as [3], but [2] cannot be restated, as seen in [4].  [3]  <ul> <li>たいてい夜本を読む。</li> <li>I read books usually at night.</li> </ul>  [4]  <ul> <li>a. *いいこと本を読む。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *本をいいこと読む。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. *本を読むいいこと。</li> </ul>","type":"Structure","relatedExpression":[""]},{"﻿title":"が (1)","description":"A particle which indicates the subject.","englishEquivalent":"","textInfo":"1. が marks the subject of a sentence when the information expressed by the subject is first introduced in a discourse. When the subject is presented as the topic (that is, the information has already been introduced into the discourse), however, the topic marker は replaces が. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ は (1)\">は1</a>) Consider the following discourse, a typical opening in folktales, which illustrates the different uses of が and は.  <ul>(1) <li>昔々一人のおじいさんが住んでいました。おじいさんはとても貧乏で した。</li> <li>Once upon a time there lived an old man. He (literally: the old man) was very poor.</li> </ul>  In the first sentence, おじいさん 'old man' appears for the first time in the discourse; おじいさん is the subject but not the topic in this sentence. Therefore, it is marked by が. The second sentence tells something about the old man introduced in the first sentence. おじいさん is now the topic; therefore, it is marked by は rather than が. Note the parallelism here between が and は in Japanese and 'a' and 'the' in English.  2. が is also replaced by は if the subject is in contrast with another element. For example, in Example (c), B could also say:  <ul>(2) <li>ステーキは美味しいです。</li> <li>Steak is good (but other food is not)./(I don't know about other food but at least) Steak is good.</li> </ul>  Here, ステーキ 'steak' is newly introduced in the discourse and is not the topic; yet it is marked by は. This is because ステーキ, in this case, is being contrasted with other food.  3. Since Interrogative words like 何 'what', 誰 'who' and どこ 'what place' can never be topics, they are never marked by は, as in (3).  <ul>(3) <li>今晩誰が/*は来ますか。</li> <li>Who is coming tonight?</li> </ul>  4. The subject in subordinate clauses is marked by が unless it is a contrasted element, as seen in (4).  <ul>(4) <li>a. 私はデビーが/*はフランスへ行くことを知らなかった。</li> <li>I didn't know that Debbie was going to France.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ジーンは僕が/*はアパートを出た時まだ寝ていた。</li> <li>Gene was still in bed when I left my apartment.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 私が/*はきのう見た映画はドイツの映画だった。</li> <li>The movie I saw yesterday was a German film.</li> </ul>  Note that topics are not presented in subordinate clauses.  3. In relative clauses, the subject may be marked by の, as in (5).  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ Relative Clause\">Relative Clause</a>, Note 3)  <ul>(5) <li>私のきのう見た映画はドイツの映画だった。</li> <li>The movie I saw yesterday was a German film.</li> </ul>  6. In some expressions, elements which are considered to be direct objects are presented as subjects and are marked by が.   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ は～が\">は~が</a>)  <ul>(6) <li>a.僕はスポーツカーが欲しい。</li> <li>I want a sports car. (Literally: To me, a sports car is desirable.)</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.春子はスペイン語が分かる。</li> <li>Haruko understands Spanish. (Literally: To Haruko, Spanish is understandable.)</li> </ul>  7. To sum up the important rules concerning が,  <ul> <li>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;が marks the subject when it is newly introduced in a discourse.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;は replaces が when the subject is a topic or a contrasted element.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrogative words are always marked by が when they are the subject of a sentence.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject in subordinate clauses is marked by が unless it is a contrasted element.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When predicates are transitive adjectives or stative transitive verbs, the elements which correspond to the direct object in English are marked by が.</li> </ul>  【Related Expression】  The topic marker は is often mistaken for a subject marker. It appears to be a subject marker because it often replaces が.

In this construction the sentence preceding ね can be any informal or formal sentence except nonpolite imperative. Thus,  <ul>(1) <li>a. *読めね。</li> <li>Read it, will you?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 読みなさいね。 </li> <li>Read it, will you?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 読んでくださいね。</li> <li>Please read it, will you?</li> </ul>  2. ね can be used as a request for either confirmation or agreement from the addressee. When a sentence expresses the speaker's strong impression of something, ね indicates the speakers request for agreement from the hearer, as in Example (a). When a sentence expresses something emotively neutral, ね indicates the speaker's request for confirmation from the hearer, as in Key Sentence and Examples (b) and (c). Here, however, Key Sentence can also be a request for agreement, if the speaker is surprised that Mr. Sakamoto doesn't smoke. These two uses of ね have diflferent intonations: the ね of agreement uses falling intonation and the ね of confirmation uses rising intonation. The ね of agreement becomes ねえ if the speaker is excited about the content of his statement. In other words, Sentenceねえ is an exclamatory sentence, as in (2).  <ul>(2) <li>A: 面白い映画でしたねえ！</li> <li>It was such an interesting film, wasn't it!</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>B:そうでしたねえ！</li> <li>Wasn't it!</li> </ul>  On the other hand, the ね of confirmation has no exclamatory overtones; it implies something like 'I am assuming X but can you confirm it?' Thus, in Key Sentence the speaker doesn't like people who smoke, and for some reason or other, he wants to confirm that Mr. Sakamoto is not one of those people.  3. ね is sometimes used in a non-sentence-final position to draw the hearer's attention to something or to confirm that the hearer has understood what has been said up to that point. ね is typically used in this manner in telephone conversations.  <ul>(3) <li>もしもし、今晩ね、銀座で飲んでから帰るからね、十一時半頃になるよ。</li> <li>Literally: Hello, tonight, OK? I go home after drinking in Ginza, you understand?, so I'll be home around 11:30. </li> <li>= Hello, tonight I'll go to Ginza to drink, so I'll be home around 11:30.</li> </ul>  4. {て/から}ね is specifically used to give a reason or a cause for the speaker's state of mind or feelings in a very indirect and vague fashion. Examples follow:  <ul>(4) <li>a. あの先生はとてもきびしくて/きびしいからね。</li> <li>(It's because) that teacher is very strict, you know?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ゆうべは飲みすぎて/飲みすぎたからね。</li> <li>(It's because) I drank too much last night, you know?</li> </ul>  ね here indicates the speaker's request for agreement from the hearer based on shared knowledge.  5. The ね of confirmation or agreement is used after another sentence-final particle よ of assertion. よね means 'I assert that ~ but don't you agree?/am I right?'. This ね is pronounced with rising intonation  <ul>(5) <li>a. 英語が分かるよね。</li> <li>Literally: I assert that you understand English but am I right? (= You understand English, don't you?)</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. あの先生はいい先生ですよね。</li> <li>That teacher is a good teacher. Don't you think so?</li> </ul>  6. The ね of confirmation or agreement is used after another sentence-final particle, the question marker か. かね means 'I am not sure if ~, am I right?'. The ね of かね is pronounced with falling intonation.  <ul>(6) <li>a. 山下君は京大に入れますかね。</li> <li>Literally: I'm not sure whether Mr. Yamashita can get into Kyoto University, but am I right? </li> <li>= I'm not sure whether Mr. Yamashita can get into Kyoto University. What do you say?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. あの先生はいい先生ですかね。</li> <li>I doubt that he is a good teacher.</li> </ul>","type":"Particle","relatedExpression":[""]},{"﻿title":"わ (2)","description":"A sentence final particle used in weak assertive or volitional sentences by a female speaker.","englishEquivalent":"","textInfo":"1. The sentence particle わ is used only in female speech and expresses the speaker's weak assertion or volition. In addition, わ sometimes expresses the speaker's intimacy or friendliness.  2. わ can follow any declarative sentence, but cannot follow the volitional forms of verbs. Thus, the following sentence is ungrammatical.  <ul>(1) <li>*私が行きましょう/行こうわ。</li> <li>I will go.</li> </ul>  Note that わ cannot be used in questions.  <ul>(2)  <li>a. *ジャクソンさんは学生ですかわ。</li> <li>Is Mr. Jackson a student?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *ジャクソンさんは学生ですわか。</li> <li>Is Mr. Jackson a student?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. *ジャクソンさんは学生ですわ？</li> <li>Is Mr. Jackson a student?</li> </ul>  3.

The sentence in the Key Sentence (A) pattern, which includes the subject Xが, implies that 'not others but X will do something'. If the sentence doesn't carry such an implication but simply states the first person's volition, the subject is usually omitted. Compare the following sentences:  <ul>(1) <li>a. その鞄を持ちましょう。</li> <li>I'll carry that bag.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私がその鞄を持ちましょう。</li> <li>I will carry that bag.</li> </ul>  3. In invitation situations like Key Sentence (B), the subject is usually omitted. (Examples (c) and (d))  4. ましょう with the question marker か asks whether the hearer will accept the speaker's volitional action or invitation. (Examples (b) and (d))  5. Negative volition is usually expressed by simple nonpast negatives, as seen in (2).  <ul>(2) <li>私はパーティーに行きません。</li> <li>I won't go to the party.</li> </ul>  (The negative volitional ending まい, as in 行くまい 'won't go', is not commonly used in modern colloquial Japanese.)  6. \"Let's not do something\" is expressed by different constructions.  <ul>(A) Verb informalのはやめましょう/よしましょう. (Literally: Let's stop doing something)</ul>  Example:  <ul>(3) <li>パ一テイ一に行くのはやめましょう/よしましょう。</li> <li>Let's not go to the party.</li> </ul>  <ul>(B) Verb negativeないでおきましょう Literally: Let's leave ~ undone.)</ul>   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ おく\">おく</a>)  Example:  <ul>(4) <li>フレッドには言わないでおきましょう。</li> <li>Let's not tell Fred.</li> </ul>  7. In indirect speech or in sentences with verbs like 思う 'think' and 決心する 'make up one's mind', the informal volitional form is used.  <ul>(5) <li>村田さんはコーヒーを飲もうと言った。</li> <li>Mr. Murata suggested we drink coffee.</li> </ul>  <ul>(6) <li>私は来年日本へ行こうと思います。</li> <li>I think I will go to Japan next year.</li> </ul>  8. Unlike English, in Japanese the volitional future and the simple future are expressed by different forms. Thus, \"I think I will see a movie.\" is expressed by either (7) or (8).  <ul>(7) <li>私は映画を見ようと思う。</li> </ul>  <ul>(8) <li>私は映画を見ると思う。</li> </ul>  (7) is an example of the volitional future, in which the speakers volition is expressed, while (8) is an example of the simple future.  【Related Expression】  An invitation by the speaker can also be expressed through negative questions，as in [1].  [1]  <ul> <li>パーティーに行きませんか。</li> <li>Wouldn't you (like to) go to the party?</li> </ul>  In invitation situations, negative questions are more polite than ましょう sentences because the former are asking whether or not the hearer will do something and, therefore, are hearer-oriented, while the latter do not consider the hearer's volition and are more speaker-oriented.","type":"Auxiliary","relatedExpression":["ませんか"]},{"﻿title":"か (1)","description":"A particle which marks an alternative.","englishEquivalent":"(either) ~ or ~","textInfo":"1. The basic function of か is to mark an alternative. It can mark either nouns or sentences. When it marks nouns, the final か is usually omitted. When it marks sentences, the sentences are subordinate clauses; that is, they must be in the informal form. The topic marker は must not be used.  2. か cannot be used to connect two questions.

(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ だい\">だい</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ かい\">かい</a>) Note that in Japanese interrogative sentences, the word order is the same as that of the corresponding declarative sentence. Also, an interrogative sentence is pronounced with rising intonation whether it is a yes-no question or a interrogative word question.  3. か remains in indirect questions as in Key Sentence (B), Examples (c) and (d).  4. When the informal forms of な type adjectives and the copula precede the question marker か, だ drops. A possible reason is that だ, the informal form of です, expresses a strong assertion and it conflicts with the question marker か, which expresses the speaker's uncertainty about something.

The negative informal form of ある is not あらない but ない.  3. Two sentence patterns can be used with ある. The Key Sentence (A) pattern is used when a location is presented as a topic. In this case, what exists is under focus. In this pattern, the location marker に can optionally drop. The Key Sentence (B) pattern is used when something which exists is presented as a topic. In this case, where it exists is under focus. Compare the two patterns in (2).  <ul>(2) <li>A: 早稲田大学はどこにありますか 。</li> <li>Where is Waseda University?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>B: 早稲田大学は東京にあります 。</li> <li>Waseda University is in Tokyo.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>A: 東京には早稲田大学しかありませんか 。</li> <li>Literally: Are there no universities in Tokyo but Waseda University?

A thing (whether animate or inanimate) can also occur in the location position of Key Sentence (A). In this case, the sentence expresses possession rather than existence. Examples:  <ul>(3) <li>a. この車(に)はカー・ステレオ がある。</li> <li>Literally: There is a car stereo in this car.(= This car has a car stereo.)</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私(に)は車がある。</li> <li>Literally: There is a car with me.(= I have a car.)</li> </ul>  Note that even if ある expresses the idea of possession, possessed things are marked not by を but by が. This is because ある essentially indicates existence.  5. When ある is used to express the idea of having and the object is animate, that object must be someone who maintains a very close relationship with the possessor, such as a family member, a relative or a friend. Thus, (4) is acceptable, but (5) is odd.  <ul>(4) <li>私(に)は子供が三人ある。</li> <li>I have three children.</li> </ul>  <ul>(5) <li>??私(に)は運転手がある。</li> <li>I have a chauffeur.</li> </ul>  Since ある in this usage is a possessive expression, it cannot be used in situations where the idea indicates existence. Thus,(6) is unacceptable.  <ul>(6) <li>*私(に)は母がもうありません。</li> <li>I don't have my mother now.</li> </ul>  In this case, いる must be used.  6. When ある is used for events such as parties and concerts, the particle marking locations must be で as in(7).

There is another possessive expression, 持っている, which is the てform of 持つ 'hold' followed by the auxiliary verb いる.

[1]  <ul> <li>窓が開いている。</li> <li>The window is open.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>私は窓を開けておく。</li> <li>I open/ will open the window (in advance).</li> </ul>  [1] simply means that the window is open. It doesn't imply that someone opened it. 開いて, the てform of 開く 'open', is an intransitive verb. As seen in [2], Verbておく means \"do something in advance for future convenience'\". An important difference between Verbてある and Verbておく is that the former expresses a state, while the latter expresses an action. Note that in Verbておく sentences, the agent is not omitted unless it is known.","type":"Auxiliary Verb (Group 1)","relatedExpression":["いる2"," おく"]},{"﻿title":"いる (1)","description":"An animate thing exists.","englishEquivalent":"Be; exist; stay","textInfo":"1. いる1 expresses existence in terms of animal life.

In general, if Verb-て expresses an action which can continue or be repeated, Verb-て expresses the continuation of the action. If Verb-て is a verb indicating a momentary action which cannot be repeated, Verb-て expresses the idea that something happened to X and X maintains the state which was created by that event. Key Sentence and Example (a) are examples of the first usage and Examples (b), (c) and (d) are examples of the second usage. Note in Example (d) that 知る the dictionary form of 知って, means 'to get to know' and 知っている expresses the continuation of the state after the speaker got to know Miss Suzuki, which is expressed by know in English. It is also noted, however, that 'not to know' is not 知っていない but 知らない. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ 知る・しる\">㊦ 知る・しる</a>)  2. Verb-ている also expresses a habitual action, which is a special sort of repeated action. Example:  <ul>(1)  <li>私は毎日四マイル走っている。</li> <li>I run four miles every day.</li> </ul> 3. When Verb-て is a motion verb such as 行く 'go', 来る 'come' and 帰る 'return', the meaning of Verb-ている is not 'be ~ing'. For example, 行っている means 'to have gone to some place and to still be there'. The sentences in (2) provide examples.  <ul>(2)  <li>a. 次郎はアメリカに行っている。</li> <li>Jiro has gone to America and is there.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ベックさんはもう家に帰っています。</li> <li>Mr. Beck has already returned home and is there.</li> </ul> 4. The verb 住む 'live' requires the Verb-ている pattern if the sentence expresses a present state. Also, verbs like 言う 'say' and 思う 'think' with a third person subject require the Verb-ている pattern if the sentence expresses a present state. Examples:  <ul>(3)  <li>a. 私は東京に住んでいる/*住む。</li> <li>I live in Tokyo.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ウェストさんは日本語はやさしいと思っている/*思う。</li> <li>Mr. West thinks that Japanese is easy.</li> </ul>","type":"Auxiliary Verb (Group 2)","relatedExpression":["ある2"]},{"﻿title":"する (1)","description":"Someone/something causes a state or action to take place.","englishEquivalent":"Do; make; play; play the role of ~; wear","textInfo":"1. する1 means 'to cause some state or action', and corresponds to English 'do' or 'make'.</P>  2.

Sino-Japanese compounds+する such as 勉強する 'study' and 運転する 'drive' can be used as transitive verbs, as in Key Sentence (E) and Example (d). The Sino-Japanese compound itself can also be used as the direct object of する. For example, compare Key Sentence (E) and Example (d) with (1) and (2), respectively.</P>  <ul>(1) <li>私は中国語の勉強をしている。</li> <li>Literally: I am doing the study of Chinese.

In contemporary Japanese it is very common to use する with loanwords. The majority of loanwords are from English verbs.

Since injury normally occurs due to human carelessness, する is acceptable, but なる is unacceptable, as shown in below. In contrast to injury, illness is assumed to occur regardless of human carefulness or carelessness, so it should not take する. But in actuality it does. Illness can take する when it is talked about as if it were something under human control, for example, cases of past illness (as in (4a)), apologies implying that one has caused illness due to carelessness on one's part (as in (4b)), and statements of one's medical history (as in (4c)).

The subject of this humble verb must be the speaker or his in-group member.</P>  <ul>(5) <li>私がお読み/書き/持ちします。</li> <li>I will read/write/carry it (for you).</li> </ul>  A further degree of humbleness can be expressed by replacing する with its humble version いたす/いたします.</P>  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ お～する\">お~する</a>)</P>  【Related Expressions】</P>  I. なる 'become' forms an intransitive-transitive pair with する, although they are not phonetically related.

In conversation, のだ/です often becomes んだ/です. In informal speech, male speakers use んだ and female speakers use の. (For the informal forms of のだ in interrogative sentences, see <a href=\"#㊦ かい\">かい</a> and <a href=\"#㊦ だい\">だい</a>.)  2. Basically, Sentenceのだ is used when the speaker is explaining or asking for an explanation about information shared with the hearer. The information is often what the speaker and the hearer have observed or heard. For example, in Key Sentences, A uses のです because he is asking for an explanation about what he sees B doing. B also uses のです because he is explaining his actions. In this situation, (1) is odd.  <ul>(1) <li>A: 何をしていますか。</li> <li>What are you doing?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>B: 日本語を勉強しています。</li> <li>I'm studying Japanese.</li> </ul>  If, however, A is only assuming that B is doing something, A can ask the question in (2), and B can answer as B does in (1).  <ul>(2) <li>あなたは今何をしていますか。</li> <li>What are you doing now?</li> </ul>  In Example (a), as in Key Sentence, A uses んです because A observes that B isn't drinking sake and wants an explanation for that. And, B also uses んです because he is explaining about what A observed. In Example (b), the speaker uses んです in the second sentence because it is an explanation about the information which has been given in the first sentence.  3. Sentenceのだ is also used when no information is shared by the speaker and the hearer and the speaker is not explaining or asking for an explanation about anything. In this case, the speaker is talking as if some information were shared with the hearer and the effects of this are, for example,  <ul>(A) <li>to involve the hearer in the affairs he is talking about (See (3) and (4) below.),</li> </ul>  <ul>and/or</ul>  <ul>(B) <li>to impose his idea upon the hearer or, at least, to emphasize his idea emotively.

However, から and ので differ in the following way. ので is used when the speaker believes that the information he provides in Sentence1ので as cause or reason for Sentence2 is valid and is also evident and acceptable to the hearer. (Examples (a) - (d)) Sentence1からSentence2, however, does not involve that assumption. Therefore, ので cannot be used and から must be used in the following situations :   (A) Sentence1 (i.e., reason/cause clause) expresses the speaker's conjecture about something.  [1]  <ul> <li>人がたくさん来るだろうから/*ので食べものをたくさん買っておいた。</li> <li>Because many people will probably come, I've bought a lot of food.</li> </ul>  (B) Sentence2 (i.e., the main clause) is a command, request, suggestion or invitation.  [2] Command  <ul> <li>この映画はためになるから/*ので行きなさい。</li> <li>Because this movie is good for you, go (see it).</li> </ul>  [3] Request  <ul> <li>あしたのショーはおもしろいから/*のでぜひ見に来てください。</li> <li>Tomorrow's show is interesting, so please come to see it.</li> </ul>  [4] Suggestion  <ul> <li>この本はとてもおもしろいから/*のでみんなも読んだほうがいいよ。</li> <li>This book is very interesting, so you'd better read it, too.</li> </ul>  [5] Invitation  <ul> <li>いい酒をもらったから/*ので一緒に飲みましょうか。</li> <li>I got some good sake, so shall we drink it together?</li> </ul>  Sentence2 expresses the speaker's volition or personal opinion.

The particle で is also used to express a reason or cause. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ で (3)\">で3</a>; Semantic Derivations of で) で, however, can be used only with nouns, while ので and から are used only with sentences. Compare [8] and [9].

The difference between で1 and を is that で1 can be used with any action verb, while を can be used only with motion verbs such as 歩く 'walk', 走る 'run', 飛ぶ 'fly' and 泳ぐ 'swim'. Thus, を is ungrammatical in [1].  [1]  <ul> <li>私は図書館で/*を勉強した。</li> <li>I studied at the library.</li> </ul>  When either で1 or を is possible, as in [2], there is usually a subtle difference between them.  [2]  <ul> <li>ジョンは川で/を泳いだ。</li> <li>John swam in the river.</li> </ul>  First, when で1 is used, other locations for an action are also implied, but when を is used, there are no such implications.

[3]  <ul> <li>ジョンはプールが嫌いだからたいてい川で/*を泳ぐ。</li> <li>John usually swims in the river because he doesn't like pools.</li> </ul>  Second, when で1 is used, the sentence often indicates that the purpose of the action is the action itselt, whereas when を is used it seems that there is another purpose behind the action. For example, in [4] John swam in order to escape, and swimming was not the purpose of his action. Therefore, を is acceptable but で1 is not.  [4]  <ul> <li>ジョンは川を/*で泳いで逃げた。</li> <li>John escaped by swimming in the river.</li> </ul>","type":"Particle","relatedExpression":["で1"]},{"﻿title":"のに (1)","description":"Contrary to everybody’s expectation based on the sentence preceding [x], the proposition in the sentence following [x] is the case.","englishEquivalent":"Even though; despite the fact that ~; although; but; in spite of the fact that ~","textInfo":"1. のに is the nominalizer の plus the particle に 'to', meaning 'in contrast to the fact that ~'.

(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ の (3)\">の3</a>) In other words, the speaker of SentenceのにSentence2 is personally involved with the proposition of Sentence1. This personal involvement tends to create some emotive overtone.  2. In colloquial speech, if the content of the main clause is predictable, the clause often drops. In this case, the sentence expresses a feeling of discontent on the part of the speaker.  <ul>(1) <li>A: そんなもの要らないよ。</li> <li>I don't need that kind of stuff.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>B: せっかくあげると言うのに。</li> <li>Literally: Although I'm kindly saying that I'll give it to you. (= I'm saying I'll give it to you, you know.)</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  I. Because of the speaker-oriented character of the のに clause, certain types of constructions involving the hearer cannot be used in the main clause in this construction. If the main clause is a request, suggestion, question, command or request for permission, only けれど(も)can be used. Examples of the above categories can be seen in [1] through [5] below:  [1]  <ul> <li>難しいけれど/*のにしてみてください。</li> <li>It is difficult, but try it, please.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>あまりおいしくないけれど/*のに食べてみませんか。</li> <li>It's not so good, but do you want to try it?</li> </ul>  [3]  <ul> <li>a. 寒いけれど/*のに外に出ますか。</li> <li>It's cold, but are you going outside?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 寒いけれど/のに外に出るんですか。</li> <li>It's cold, but (literally: is it that you are going outside?) are you going outside?</li> </ul>  [4]  <ul> <li>つまらないけれど/*のに読みなさい。</li> <li>It's boring, but read it.</li> </ul>  [5]  <ul> <li>下手だけれど/*下手なのにしてもいいですか。</li> <li>I'm not good at it, but can I do it?</li> </ul>  [3b] is acceptable, because the scope of the question is not the main verb 出る 'go outside' but the whole sentence nominalized by ん.  II. The main clause cannot be an expression of intention as in [6], because the expression is directed not towards the speaker but towards the hearer.   [6]  <ul> <li>分からないけれど/*のによく考えてみるつもりです/考えてみようと思います。</li> <li>Although I don't understand it, I intend to really think about it/I think I will really think about it.</li> </ul>  III. Due to the nominalizer の, the のに clause tends to express something with which the speaker is emotively involved. But けれど(も) is relatively free from the speakers emotive involvement; in short, it is more objective than のに.  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ の (3)\">の3</a>)  IV. のに in Examples (a) through (d) can also be replaced by the disjunctive conjunction が 'but'. For example, Example (d) can be rewritten as [7].  [7]  <ul> <li>父は九十歳だが、まだ働いている。</li> <li>My father is ninety years old, but he is still working.</li> </ul>  The disjunctive meaning of が is much weaker than that of のに, and が is free from the restrictions imposed on のに. The style of the のに clause is always informal, but depending on the style of the second sentence, the style of the sentence preceding が can be either informal or formal, as shown below:  <table class=\"table\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">Sentence informalがSentence informal/formal</td> <td class=\"td\">vs</td> <td class=\"td\">Sentence informalのにSentence informal/formal</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">Sentence formalがSentence formal</td> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\"></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>","type":"Conjunction","relatedExpression":["が"," けれど(も)"]},{"﻿title":"でも","description":"The て form of です plus も ‘even’.","englishEquivalent":"Even","textInfo":"1.

The origin of は can be traced to the conditional marker ば. (Compare the spellings of は and ば) (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ ば\">ば</a>) However, in contemporary Japanese, は is used, in general, to mark information which the speaker assumes to be part of the hearer's register. In other words, when は marks X, the speaker usually assumes that the hearer knows what X refers to. Thus, noun phrases which can be marked by は in ordinary circumstances are as follows:  (A) Common nouns whose referents have already been introduced into the discourse linguistically or extra-linguistically. Example:  <ul>(1) <li>昔々、一人のおじいさんが住んでいました。</li> <li>Once upon a time, there lived an old man.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>おじいさんはとてもやさしい人でした。</li> <li>The old man was a very gentle man.</li> </ul>  (B) Proper nouns. Examples:  <ul>(2) <li>アメリカ&nbsp;&nbsp;America</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>スミスさん&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Smith</li> </ul>  (C) Nouns whose referents can be uniquely identified (that is, they are one of a kind). Examples:  <ul>(3) <li>太陽&nbsp;&nbsp;sun</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>空&nbsp;&nbsp;sky</li> </ul>  (D) Generic names. Examples:  <ul>(4) <li>人&nbsp;&nbsp;man</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>車&nbsp;&nbsp;car</li> </ul>  It is noted that は never marks interrogative words such as 何 'what' and 誰 'who' .Thus, (5) is ungrammatical.  <ul>(5) <li>*誰はパーティーに来ましたか。</li> <li>Who came to the party?</li> </ul>  This is because interrogative words do not refer to a known thing and, therefore, their referents can never be in the hearer's register.  2. More specifically, は marks a topic and/or a contrastive element. When は is used as a topic marker, as in XはY, X is something the rest of the sentence (i.e., Y) is about, and the focus of the sentence falls on Y or part of Y. The topic Xは normally appears at the beginning of a sentence.  3. は is also used to mark a contrastive element, as in Key Sentence (B), Examples (c) and (d). However, whether は is being used as a topic marker or as a contrastive marker is not always clear. This is not clear particularly when there is one element X marked by は but there is no other element Y explicitly contrasted with X. Here are some general rules for determining whether a given は is topical or contrastive.  (A) When more than one は appears in a sentence, as in \"XはYはZは...\", the first は is usually understood to be the topic marker, the second は is more contrastive than the first one, the third one is more contrastive than the second, and so on. Examples :  <ul>(6) <li>太郎はテニスは出来ます。</li> <li>Taro can play tennis.</li> </ul>  <ul>(7) <li>僕は今日はテニスはしない。</li> <li>I won't play tennis today.</li> </ul>  (B) When Xは is pronounced with stress, it marks a contrastive element. Examples:  <ul>(8) <li>私は一年です。</li> <li>(I don't know about other people but, at least) I am a freshman.</li> </ul>  <ul>(9) <li>ビールは飲みます。</li> <li>(I don't drink other drinks but) I drink beer.</li> </ul>  4. When は is used in negative sentences, it marks the negated element. This is a special use of は as a contrastive marker. Compare the following sentences:  <ul>(10) <li>a. 私はきのうボストンへ行かなかった。</li> <li>I didn't go to Boston yesterday.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私はきのうはボストンへ行かなかった。</li> <li>I didn't go to Boston yesterday.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 私はきのうボストンへは行かなかった。</li> <li>I didn't go to Boston yesterday.</li> </ul>  (10a) simply states that the speaker didn't go to Boston yesterday. (10b) negates yesterday, implying that the speaker went to Boston on other days or that he usually goes to Boston on that day but didn't yesterday. Likewise, (10c) negates to Boston, implying that the speaker went somewhere but it was not to Boston.  5. There are rules for particle ellipsis when は marks noun phrases with case markers (i.e., particles such as the subject marker が (= <a href=\"#㊦ が (1)\">が1</a>) and the direct object marker を (= <a href=\"#㊦ を (1)\">を1</a>)).  (A) When は marks Xがa or Xを, が or を must drop. (Examples (a) and (c))  (B) When は marks Xへ or Xに6 (location), へ or に optionally drop, (Example (b))  (C) When は marks Xに1/に2/に3/に4 (time, indirect object, agent, contact), Xで, Xと, Xから, Xまで or Xより, the case marker usually remains and は follows it, forming a double particle. (Example (d)) More examples follow:  <ul>(11) <li>ここではたばこを吸わないでください。</li> <li>Please don't smoke here.</li> </ul>  <ul>(12) <li>田中さんとはよく会います。</li> <li>I see Mr. Tanaka often.</li> </ul>  6. The topical は does not appear in subordinate clauses, as in (13).  <ul>(13) <li>a.花子は私が/*はきのう酒を飲んだことを知っている。</li> <li>Hanako knows that I drank sake yesterday.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.私が/*は読んだ本は「雪国」です。</li> <li>The book I read was Snow Country.</li> </ul>","type":"Particle","relatedExpression":["が"]},{"﻿title":"も","description":"A particle which indicates that a proposition about the preceeding element X is also true when another similar proposition is true.","englishEquivalent":"Too; also; (not) ~ either","textInfo":"1. In general, when the element Xも appears in a sentence, a related sentence with the element Y (plus particle if necessary) in place of Xも is presupposed. For example, when a speaker states (1), a sentence like (2) is presupposed.  <ul>(1) <li>私はニューヨークへも行った。</li> <li>I went to New York, too.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>私はボストンへ行った。</li> <li>I went to Boston.</li> </ul>  Thust when Xも appears in a sentence, Xも is always the element under focus in that sentence.   2. There are cases in which Xも is used, althougn it does not exactly replace the element Y in the presupposed sentence. For example, (3b) can be spoken after (3a).  <ul>(3)  <li>a. 私の家は居間がせまい。</li> <li>The living room of my house is small.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. それに台所も不便だ。</li> <li>On top of that, the kitchen is inconvenient, too.</li> </ul>  In this case, the speaker implies that his house is inconvenient when he says (3a), and this implication is the presupposition of (3b), where the speaker elaborates on the inconvenience.  3. \"XもAだ\" cannot be used to mean 'X is also A' in the sense that X is A as well as something else. \"XもAだ\" can be used only when \"Yは/がAだ\" presupposed. Thus, (4) does not mean (5). (In fact, (4) is nonsensical if it is stated by the same person.)  <ul>(4) <li>私は医者だ。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*私も先生だ。</li> </ul>  <ul>(5) <li>I am a (medical) doctor.

When Noun1とNoun2 is used as the subject of a sentence, the sentence may be ambiguous. In Example (d), for example, without adequate context we cannot tell if Mr. Yamamoto and Mr. Smith are playing tennis together. If the predicate contains reciprocal words such as 似る 'resemble', 同じだ 'be the same' and 結婚する 'marry', however, sentences with \"Noun1とNoun2\" in subject position are not ambiguous, as seen in Example (e).  【Related Expressions】  I.

Thus, と often corresponds to the English 'with', as in 'in the company of'. と also appears with such reciprocal verbs and adjectives as 結婚する 'marry', 喧嘩する 'quarrel', 話し合う 'discuss with', 似る 'resemble', 違う 'differ' and 同じだ 'be the same'. (See Examples (b), (c) and (d).)  2. In reciprocal sentences, the subject and X in X to are interchangeable.

The て form functions, in part, to link sentences. That is, if the last element of the predicate of a clause is the て form, it means that that clause is not the end of the sentence and that another predicate or clause follows it.

The meaning of the て form varies according to context, but generally, it corresponds to 'and' or '-ing' in participial constructions.  3. When the て form links two predicates, the relationship between the two is often one of the following:  [A1: the action or state expressed by the first predicate; A2: the action or state expressed by the second predicate]  <ul>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;A1 and A2 occur sequentially, as in Key Sentence (1) and Example (a).</ul>  <ul>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;A1 and A2 are two states of someone or something, as in Key Sentence (2), Key Sentence (4), Examples (c) and (f).</ul>  <ul>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;A1 is the reason for or the cause of A2, as in Key Sentence (3), Examples (b), (d), (e) and (g).

(A) When the verb in Sentence1 is not a movement verb:  <ul>(4)  <li>a. 私はご飯を食べる時手を洗う。</li> <li>I (will) wash my hands (right) before I eat my meal.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私はご飯を食べた時手を洗う。</li> <li>I (will) wash my hands (right) after I've eaten my meal.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 私はご飯を食べる時手を洗った。</li> <li>I washed my hands (right) before I ate my meal.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. 私はご飯を食べた時手を洗った。</li> <li>I washed my hands (right) after I ate my meal.</li> </ul>  (B) When the verb in Sentence1 is a movement verb:  <ul>(5)  <li>a. 私はシカゴへ行く時すしを食べるつもリだ。</li> <li>I'm going to eat sushi</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) (right) before I leave for Chicago. </li> <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) on the way to Chicago.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>b. 私はシカゴへ行った時すしを食べるつもリだ。</li> <li>I'm going to eat sushi after I've arrived in Chicago.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>c. 私はシカゴへ行く時すしを食べた。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) I ate sushi (right) before I left for Chicago. </li> <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) I ate sushi on the way to Chicago.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>d. 私はシカゴへ行った時すしを食べた。</li> <li>I ate sushi after I arrived in Chicago.</li> </ul>  (C) When the action in Sentence1 and the action in Sentence2 take place simultaneously or concurrently:  <ul>(6)  <li>a. 私はシカゴへ行く時車で行く。</li> <li>When I go to Chicago, I go by car.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *私はシカゴへ行った時車で行く。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 私はシカゴへ行く時車で行った。</li> <li>When I went to Chicago, I went by car.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. 私はシカゴへ行った時車で行った。</li> <li>When I went to Chicago, I went by car.</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  Unlike when-clauses in English, 時 clauses do not indicate condition. In other words, 時 clauses are genuine time clauses. In order to indicate condition as expressed in when-clauses, conjunctions like たら and と are used. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ たら\">たら</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ と (4)\">と4</a>) Thus, if [1] expresses a condition which causes the hearer surprise, 時 cannot be used.  [1]  <ul> <li>You will be surprised when you see it.</li> </ul>  In this case, tara or to must be used, as in [2].  [2]  <ul> <li>それを{見たら/見ると/*見る時/*見た時}おどろきますよ。</li> <li>You'll be surprised when you see it.</li> </ul>","type":"Noun","relatedExpression":["たら"," と4"]},{"﻿title":"もの（だ）","description":"The speaker presents some situation as if it were a tangible object.","englishEquivalent":"Because; how could ~!; used to; should like to; should","textInfo":"1. Because the speaker presents a situation before もの(だ) as if it were a tangible object, this structure tends to convey differing degrees of emotion. Key Sentences (A) through (F) represent emotive excuse, exclamation, nostalgic reminiscence, desire, indirect command and conviction, respectively. Note, however, that the emotion expressed here is not an instantaneously appearing emotion instigated by a current event but an emotion nurtured in one's mind for a relatively long period time.  2. When もの indicates a reason or an excuse it is used only in very informal speech.  3. もの is contracted into もん in very colloquial speech.  4. The usage of もの in Key Sentence (A) does not take だ/です, unless it appears in a subordinate clause, as in (1).  <ul>(1) <li>金がないもんで映画も見られないんだ。</li> <li>Because I don't have money, I can't see even a movie, you know</li> </ul>  【Related Expression】  In Key Sentences (A), (C), (D), (E) and (F) もの can be replaced by の, but with a slightly different meaning. もの sounds more emotive than の, probably due to the semantic difference between もの 'a tangible object' and の 'a nominalizer of a directly perceptible state or action'. Thus, the もの(だ) version is more indirectly emotive, and is not necessarily geared to the current moment, whereas the の(だ) version is more directly emotive and is geared to the current moment. Observe the following:  [1]  <ul> <li>今ビールが飲みたいん/*ものです。</li> <li>I'd like to drink beer now.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>今すぐ会いに行くん/*ものです。</li> <li>You should go see him at once.</li> </ul>  Note that もの in Key Sentence (A) can be replaced by から, but the latter is free from the emotive overtones which are attached to もの.","type":"Noun","relatedExpression":["から"," のだ"]},{"﻿title":"こと (1)","description":"A thing which is intangible.","englishEquivalent":"Thing; what","textInfo":"1. こと means a thing which is intangible. Thus,(1) is ungrammatical.  <ul>(1) <li>*おいしいことはありませんか。</li> <li>Literally: Isn't there a delicious thing?</li> </ul>  2. Nounのこと, whose literal meaning is 'thing of Noun' is often used with such verbs as 知っている 'know', 話す 'talk' and 忘れる 'forget', and means 'know about Noun', 'talk about Noun', etc.  3. こと is used as a nominalizer, too. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ こと (2)\">こと2</a>) Example (b), for instance, is ambiguous without proper context. That is, it means either 'Do you remember the thing which the teacher said?' or 'Do you remember (the fact) that the teacher said (it)?'  【Related Expression】  もの also means 'thing', but it means 'a tangible thing'.

The subject of a statement containing つもりだ must be the first person or someone with whom the speaker empathizes. In a question, however, the subject must be the second person or someone with whom the hearer empathizes.  <ul>(2) <li>a. 僕/母/友逢/*あのサラリーマン/*あなたは食べるつもりだ。</li> <li>I/My mother/My friend/That salaried man/You intend(s) to eat it.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *僕/*母/*友達/山田さん/あなたは食べるつもりですか。</li> <li>Do / Does I / my mother / my friend / Mr. Yamada / you intend to eat it?</li> </ul>  3. つもりだ can be negated in two ways. The verb/adjective in front of つもり can be negated, as in Example (c), or つもり can be negated as つもりはない (not *つもりではない), as in Example (b). The difference between these two negative versions is that the second version implies stronger negation than the first one, as shown by (3) below:  <ul>(3) <li>A: 今晩の音楽会に行くつもりですか。</li> <li>Do you intend to go to tonight's concert?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>B: まだよく分かりませんが、多分、行かないつもりです/??行くつもりはありません。</li> <li>I can't tell for sure now, but probably I'm not going there.</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  I. つもり should not be confused with はず which means 'expectation' rather than 'conviction'.

Secondly, ようと思う indicates a spur-of-the moment decision while つもりだ indicates a more stable conviction/intention.

Thus, when the speaker uses はず he is not merely guessing, but stating a proposition based on reliable information or knowledge.   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ だろう\">だろう</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ らしい\">らしい</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ そうだ (2)\">そうだ2</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ ようだ\">ようだ</a>)  2. はず is a dependent noun and cannot be used alone. It is always modified by a sentence or a demonstrative such as その 'that' and こんな 'like this'. \"Demonstrative はず\" is used when a proposition is known to the hearer from the context, as in (1).  <ul>(1) <li>A: マーサも来ますか。</li> <li>Is Martha coming, too?</li>  <li>B: はい、そのはずです。</li> <li>Yes, I expect so.</li> </ul>  3. Negative expectations can be expressed in two ways:  (A) Sentence (negative) はずだ  <ul>(2) <li>クラークさんはパーティーに行かないはずだ。</li> <li>Literally: I expect that Mr. Clark is not going to the party.</li> <li>(= I don't expect that Mr. Clark is going to the party.)</li> </ul>  (B) Sentenceはずは/がない  <ul>(3) <li>クラークさんはパーティーに行くはずは/がない。</li> <li>Literally: I have no expectation that Mr. Clark is going to the party.</li> <li>(= It is improbable that Mr. Clark will go to the party.)</li> </ul>  The assertion in (3) is stronger than that in (2).  4. \"Sentenceはず\" can also be used when the speaker has discovered the reason for an event or a state. In this case, はず means \"It is natural that ~.\" or \"No wonder ~.\" and can be paraphrased as \"Sentenceわけだ.\" (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ わけだ\">わけだ</a>) Example:  <ul>(4) <li>高いはずだ。これは金だ。</li> <li>No wonder this is expensive.

In these cases, it never expresses purpose. Consider the additional examples in (1).  <ul>(1) <li>a. 仕事の為に何もほかの事が出来ない。</li> <li>Because of the job I can't do anything else.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 会社の為に朝から晚まで働いている。</li> <li>He's working from morning till night for the sake of his company.</li> </ul>  (1a) gets the reason/cause interpretation, because the main clause describes a noncontrollable situation, whereas (1b) gets the purpose interpretation, because the main clause describes a controllable situation.  2. The に of 為に can be dropped, as in Examples (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g), if a phrase(s) intervenes between the main verb and 為に.  【Related Expressions】  I. When 為 is used to mean reason or cause, it can be replaced by から or ので. Thus, Key Sentence (C) and Example (d) can be rephrased as [1a] and [1b], respectively.

(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ から (3)\">から3</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ ので\">ので</a>)  II. When 為 is used to mean purpose, it can be replaced by either Verb informal nonpastのに or Verbますに Verb of motion. However, 為に can be replaced by のに only when one does something in the process of achieving some goal. Thus, [3a] can be paraphrased as [3b] but [4a] cannot be paraphrased as [4b].

The second person subject in declarative sentences and the first person subject in interrogative sentences are usually omitted. (Key Sentence and Examples (a) and (b)) When the subject is the third person, it is not omitted unless it can be clearly understood from the context. In this case, the speaker is telling the hearer what the speaker suggests for the third person. (Example (c))  3. Verb informal nonpast can be substituted for Verb informal past, as in (1).  <ul>(1) <li>日本語の本を読むほうがいい。</li> <li>You'd better read Japanese books.</li> </ul>  The meaning of Verb informal nonpast ほうがいい is almost the same as that of Verb informal past ほうがいい if it is used in situations of suggestion. However, Verb informal past ほうがいい may express a stronger suggestion than Verb informal nonpast ほうがいい. For instance, in the following example, Verb informal past ほうがいい is more appropriate.  <ul>(2) <li>お前、このごろ麻薬をやってるそうだな。そんなもの止めた/??止めるほうがいいぜ。</li> <li>I heard you are taking drugs these days. You'd better stop such things, I tell you.</li> </ul>  4. \"Had better not do something\" is expressed by Verb negative ないほうがいい.

Addressing someone as \"Mr. Ito\", however, is too formal in such a situation.)  <ul>(1) <li>*川口さんはいつも伊藤さんにたばこをくれる。</li> <li>Mr. Kawaguchi always gives Mr. Ito cigarettes.</li> </ul>  2.

Therefore, if the first person is the giver in くれる sentences, a viewpoint conflict arises, making the sentences ungrammatical. (In this case, あげる must be used.)  3.

(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ 呉れる・くれる (1)\">くれる1</a>)  <ul>(1)  <li>a. 知らない人が私にコーラを買ってくれた。</li> <li>A stranger bought cola for me.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *私は知らない人にコーラを買ってくれた。</li> <li>I bought cola for a stranger.</li> </ul>  (In the case in (1b), あげる 'give' must be used. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ あげる (2)\">あげる2</a>)) Note that if the subject is the first person, sentences with Verbてくれる are ungrammatical even if the person who receives the favor is someone the speaker empathizes with, as in (2).   (See <a href=\"#㊦ 呉れる・くれる (1)\">くれる1<a/>, Note 2.)  <ul>(2) <li>*私は母にケーキを焼いてくれた。</li> <li>I baked a cake for my mother.</li> </ul>  In this case, あげる must be used.  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ あげる (2)\">あげる2</a>)  2. As in Key Sentence (B), if the person receiving the benefit of the action is the direct object, the indirect object is omitted. Therefore, (3a) and (3b) are ungrammatical.  <ul>(3) <li>a. *道男は私に私をなぐさめてくれた。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *道男は私になぐさめてくれた。</li> </ul>  3. If the main verb of the sentence is intransitive, the person receiving the benefit of the action is not marked by に.Therefore, (4) is ungrammatical.  <ul>(4)  <li>*みんなは私に働いてくれた。</li> <li>Everybody worked for me.</li> </ul>  In this case, の為に 'for the sake of' is used, as in (5),   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ 為(に)・ため(に)\">ため</a>)  <ul>(5) <li>みんなは私のために働いてくれた。</li> <li>Everybody worked for my sake.</li> </ul>  4. The polite (honorific) version of Verbてくれる is Verbてくださる. Example:  <ul>(6) <li>先生は私に本を貸してくださった。</li> <li>My teacher kindly lent me a book.</li> </ul>  5. Note that in sentences like \"Mr. A taught me ~\", \"Mr. A bought me ~\" and \"Mr. A lent me ~\", which usually imply that the speaker received some sort of favor, Verbてくれる (or くださる) should be used, though in English this is not usually explicitly expressed. In Japanese, without the auxiliary verbs くれる or くださる, such sentences don't convey the idea that the speaker received a favor.  6. The indirect object is often omitted if it refers to the speaker in declarative sentences or to the hearer in interrogative sentences.  (See Key Sentence (A), Examples (a) and (c).)  【Related Expressions】  あげる, くれる and もらう and all their polite and non-polite versions are used as auxiliary verbs with Verbて. (Auxiliary verbs あげる, くれる and もらう are explained under あげる2, くれる2 and もらう2, respectively.) When these verbs are used as auxiliary verbs, the same viewpoint rules stated in くれる1 Related Expression I apply, except that there is no neutral viewpoint.","type":"Auxiliary Verb (Group 2)","relatedExpression":["あげる2"," くれる1"," もらう2"]},{"﻿title":"来る・くる (1)","description":"Someone or something moves in a direction towards the speaker or the speaker’s viewpoint or area of empathy.","englishEquivalent":"Come; visit; show up","textInfo":"から commonly describes a movement towards a place where the speaker physically exists, as in Key Sentence and Example (d). However, it can also describe a movement in a direction where the speaker has placed his viewpoint or where he feels strong empathy. For example, in Example (a) the speaker, who apparently did not attend the party, is taking the viewpoint of the hearer, who did attend. In Example (c) the speaker is phoning and is not at the hearer's house, yet he is taking the hearer's viewpoint, a typical example of the psychological fusion between speaker and hearer. In Example (b), it is possible that the speaker lives nearer Nagoya than Mr. Kiguchi does and feels that Mr. Kiguchi is entering his (the speaker's) territory or area of strong empathy. And again, in Example (e), the use of 来る indicates that the speaker's office as well as his house can be considered his territory or area of empathy.  【Related Expression】  If a movement is towards a place where the speaker can place his viewpoint, 来る is used, but if a movement is towards a place where the speaker cannot place his viewpoint, 行く is used.  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ 行く・いく (1)\">行く</a>1)  In Examples (a) and (c) both 来る and 行く are acceptable. The difference is that the use of 来る shifts the focus of the sentence to the hearer's viewpoint while 行く shifts it to the speaker's viewpoint.","type":"Verb (Irregular)","relatedExpression":["行く1"]},{"﻿title":"として","description":"A compound particle which indicates the capacity, role or function of someone or something.","englishEquivalent":"As; in the capacity of","textInfo":"","type":"Particle","relatedExpression":[""]},{"﻿title":"ないで","description":"A negative て form of a verb.","englishEquivalent":"Do not do something and; without doing ~","textInfo":"1. If a ないで clause expresses something one is expected to do, as in Key Sentence where there is the expectation that Nancy should eat breakfast, the translation is 'without ~ing', but if not, it is 'do not do ~ and ~', as in Example (a).  2. ないで is often used to combine two sentences as in Key Sentence and Examples (a) and (b) but can also be used with 下さい 'please do something', as in Example (c), 欲しい 'want', as in Example (d), もらう 'receive a favor', as in Example (e), and ておく 'do something in advance', as in Example (f).  3. ないで is used only with verbs. It cannot be used with adjectives.  4. In cases where no auxiliaries such as 下さい, 欲しい, もらう and ておく are used, ないで implies that the speaker is emphasizing negation, because somehow the proposition expressed in the ないで clause is contrary to his expectation.  【Related Expressions】  I. ないで can be replaced by ずに, if で of ないで somehow retains the original meaning of 'and' as in Key Sentence, Examples (a), (b) and (f). Thus, the sentences in [1] are all grammatical, but those in [2] are all ungrammatical:  [1]  <ul> <li>a. ナンシーはきのう朝ご飯を食べずに学校へ行った。&nbsp;&nbsp;[Complementiser phrase: Key Sentence]</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 中田さんは大阪に行かずに京都に行った。&nbsp;&nbsp;[Complementiser phrase: Example (a)]</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 辞書を使わずに読んでください。&nbsp;&nbsp;[Complementiser phrase: Example (b)]</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. まだあるから買わずにおきました。&nbsp;&nbsp;[Complementiser phrase: Example (f)]</li> </ul>   [2]  <ul> <li>a. *まだ帰らずにください。&nbsp;&nbsp;[Complementiser phrase: Example (c)]</li> <li><div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *電話せずに欲しい。&nbsp;&nbsp;[Complementiser phrase: Example (d)]</li> </ul>   The only difference between ないで and ずに is that of style: ずに is used in formal speech or written Japanese. The formation is exactly the same as ないで, namely, Verb informal negativeずに. However, the ずに form for する verbs is not しずに, but せずに, as in 勉強せずに, 'without studying'.  II. ないで can be replaced by なくて only when the ないで clause indicates some cause for human emotion which is expressed in the main clause. Otherwise, the なくて version is unacceptable, as in [5].  [3]  <ul> <li>僕は英語が話せないで/???ずに/なくて恥ずかしかった。</li> <li>I felt ashamed because I couldn't speak English.</li> </ul>  [4]  <ul> <li>スージーが遊びに来ないで/???ずに/なくて助かった。</li> <li>I felt relieved, because Susie didn't come see me.</li> </ul>  [5]  <ul> <li>a. —郎は帽子を脱がないで/ずに/*なくて部屋に入った。</li> <li>Ichiro entered the room without taking off his hat.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 見ないで/*ずに/*なくてください。</li> <li>Please don't look at it.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 食べないで/ずに/*なくておいた。</li> <li>I left it uneaten.</li> </ul>  It is also noted that the idea of 'X is not Y but Z' is expressed by なくて rather than ないで, as in [6].

The cause and effect relation indicated by なくて is much weaker and more indirectly presented than that of ないから or ないので. Thus, Key Sentence can be rewritten in four versions, including ないで, as shown in [3].  [3]  <ul> <li>朝七時に起きられなくて/ないで/なかったから/なかったので会社に遅れました。</li> </ul>  The most direct presentation oi tne cause-effect relation is なかったから, and the presentation becomes more indirect in the following order: なかったので, ないで and なくて. For an excuse for one's lateness the least direct one is of course preferred, because the more indirect, the politer the expression.

In either case, when the speaker uses ようだ, his statement is based on firsthand, reliable information (usually visual information).  2. ようだ can be used in counter-factual situations, as in Ex. (d). In this case, the adverb まるで 'just' can be used for emphasis.  <ul>(1) <li>木村さんはまるで酒を飲んだようだ。</li> <li>Mr. Kimura looks as if he had just drunk sake.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>あの人はまるで日本人のようです。</li> <li>That person is just like a Japanese person.</li> </ul>  3. ようだ is a な type adjective and has the prenominal form ような and the adverbial form ように.

The colloquial version of ようだ is みたいだ, which is also a な type adjective. The uses of みたいだ are exactly the same as those for ようだ. The formation rules are as follows:  <ul>(5)  <li>{Verb/Adjectiveい} informal みたいだ</li> </ul>  <ul>(6) <li>{Adjective な stem/Noun} {Ø/だった} みたいだ</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  The conjecture expressions Sentenceだろう, Sentenceらしい and Sentenceそうだ2 convey ideas similar to Sentenceようだ. The differences are as follows：  (A) <ul>Sentenceだろう expresses the speaker's conjecture, but it is not necessarily based on any information. In other words, Sentenceだろう can be used when the speaker is merely guessing.</ul>  (B) <ul>Sentenceらしい usually expresses the speaker's conjecture based on what the speaker has heard or read. That is, the information his conjecture is based on is not firsthand.</ul>  (C) <ul>Sentenceそうだ2 expresses the speaker's conjecture about what is going to happen or the current state of someone or something. Although this expression is based on what the speaker sees or feels, it is merely his guess and the degree of certainty in his statement is fairly low. Only Verbます or Adjective (い/な) stem can precede そうだ2.</ul>  (D) <ul>Sentenceようだ is also an expression which is usually based on what the speaker sees or saw. However, unlike Sentenceそうだ2, this expression involves the speaker's reasoning process based on firsthand, reliable information and his knowledge. Thus, the degree of certainty in ようだ is the highest of the four expressions compared here.</ul>   The following examples demonstrate the differences among these four expressions. The sentences in [1] present examples with the adjective 高い 'expensive' before the conjecture auxiliaries.  [1]  <ul> <li>a.この本は高いだろう。</li> <li>This book is probably expensive.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. この本は高いらしい。</li> <li>(From what I heard and/or read,) this book seems expensive.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. この本は高そうだ。</li> <li>This book looks expensive.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. この本は高いようだ。</li> <li>(Considering the prices of similar books,) tins book seems expensive.</li> </ul>  Here, [1a] is mere conjecture, [1b] expresses the speaker's conjecture based on what he has heard and/or read. (If the sentence involves little conjecture, it is almost like hearsay. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ そうだ (1)\">そうだ1</a>)) [1c] is also the speaker's guess, but in this case it is based on what he sees. [1d] expresses the speaker's judgment about the price of the book. Note that in [1d] the speaker knows the book's price; therefore, this is not a guess. [2] provides examples with the noun 先生 'teacher' preceding the conjecture words. The differences in meaning among the sentences here are the same as those explained in [1], except that [2c] is ungrammatical.   [2]  <ul> <li>a. あの人は先生だろう。</li> <li>I guess he is a teacher.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. あの人は先生らしい。</li> <li>(From what I heard,) he seems to be a teacher.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. *あの人は先生そうだ。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. あの人は先生のようだ。</li> <li>(Judging from how he looks,) he seems to be a teacher/He looks as if he were a teacher.</li> </ul>  In [3], the verb 降る 'fall' precedes the conjecture auxiliaries.  [3]  <ul> <li>a. 今日は雨が降るだろう。</li> <li>I guess it will rain today.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 今日は雨が降るらしい。</li> <li>(From what I heard,) it seems that it will rain today.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 今にも雨が降りそうだ。</li> <li>It looks like it's going to rain at any moment.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. この辺はよく雨が降るようだ。</li> <li>(Judging from the abundance of trees and moss,) it appears that it rains a lot around here.</li> </ul>  Here, [3a] is the speaker's guess. [3b] is the speaker's conjecture based on what he heard or it is almost like hearsay. [3c] is also the speaker's guess, but, in this case, he is probably looking at the sky. Like [3c], [3d] is based on what the speaker sees, but in this case the information is reliable, and involves the speaker's reasoning process.

Since 欲しい expresses a very personal feelings the experiencer is usually the first person in declarative sentences and the second person in interrogative sentences, as in Key Sentence (A), Examples (a) and (b).

There are a number of time expressions that cannot take に; the typical ones are 朝 'morning', 明日 'tomorrow', 昨日 'yesterday', 今日 'today', 一昨日 'the day before yesterday', 来年 'next year', 最近 'lately', etc. Generally speaking, if a time expression can be specified uniquely in terms of digits, the adverb can take に; otherwise, it cannot. 月曜日 'Monday' is the 'first' day of the week, so it can take に. So can クリスマス 'Christmas', because it is December 25. But 今日 'today' cannot take に, because 'today' cannot be uniquely specified by date.  2. に is optional with certain time nouns, such as 夏 'summer' (as in Example (c)) and 時 'time' (as in Example (e)). The version with に stresses the point of time more than the version without に does.  3. The time noun 間 also takes に if the event in the main clause does not continue for the entire duration of the event in the 間 clause, as seen in Example (d). If the event in the main clause covers the same duration as the event in the 間 clause, に cannot be used.

Any transitive verb used in the Verbてあげる or Verbてあげる construction can take に, if the verb does not take a human direct object. For example, 読む 'read', which does not take a human object, can take に2, if used in the Verbてあげる or Verbてくれる construction, as shown in (1), but ほめる 'praise', which takes a human object, cannot take に, as shown in (2).  <ul>(1) <li>小さい時お母さんは私によく本を読んでくれた。</li> <li>When I was small, my mother often read me books.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>先生は私を/*にほめてくださいました。</li> <li>My teacher praised me.</li> </ul>  An intransitive verb can never take に even if it is used in the Verbてあげる or Verbてくれる construction.

Sentence1 represents a condition and Sentence2 a proposition which holds or will hold true under the condition. (ば is, in fact, the origin of the topic marker は.)   2. Sentence2 can be a statement of the speaker's volition or hope, as in Examples (c) and (d).  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ と (4)\">と4</a>)  3. Sentence2 can be a command, a request or a suggestion, as in Examples (e) and (f). In this case, however, Sentence1 cannot be an action.  Thus, in (1) and (2) ば is ungrammatical.   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ なら\">なら</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ たら\">たら</a>)  <ul>(1) <li>山本さんが来たら/*来れば知らせてください。</li> <li>If Mr. Yamamoto comes in, please let me know.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>シカゴへ行く(の)なら/*行けばバスで行ったらどうですか。</li> <li>If you go to Chicago, why don't you go by bus?</li> </ul>  4. Sentence1 can express both factual and counterfactual conditions. Thus, Examples (c) and (d) can be either factual or counterfactual statements.  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ ばよかった\">ばよかった</a>)  5. Sentence1 can be a state or an event in the past if it is counterfactual or habitual. Examples:  <ul>(3) <li>もっと安ければ買いました 。</li> <li>I would have bought it if it had been much cheaper.</li> </ul>  <ul>(4) <li>雨が降ればよく家で本を読んだものだ 。</li> <li>When it rained, I often read at home.</li> </ul>  However, Sentence1 cannot be a single factual event in the past even if it represents a condition, as seen in (5).

For example, (6) does not suggest that one should not approach the cage. It is acceptable only when it means, as a mere conditional statement, which one is in danger under the condition that one gets close to the cage.  <ul>(6) <li>そのおりに近づけばあぶないですよ。</li> <li>It is dangerous if you get close to the cage.</li> </ul>  In order to suggest that one should not approach the cage, 近づくと or 近づいたら is used instead of 近づけば.  7.

The meaning of Sentence1たらSentence2 varies depending on the contents of Sentence1 and Sentence2 and also on the situation in which this construction is used. However, Sentence always represents an antecedent and Sentence2 a subsequence. For example, in Key Sentence, Mr. Yamada's coming precedes the speaker's returning home. Likewise, in Example (a), the speaker's asking his teacher precedes his understanding something. If this relation does not hold, this construction cannot be used. For example, (1) cannot be expressed by the たら construction because the event of Sentence1, the speaker's going to Chicago, does not precede the event of Sentence2, his going there by car.  <ul>(1) <li>When I go to Chicago, I usually go by car.</li> <li>*私はシカゴへ行ったらたいてい車で行きます。</li> </ul>  (In this situation, 時 is used. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ 時・とき\">時</a>)) For the same reason, たら is ungrammatical in the situation in (2).  <ul>(2) <li>If you go to Chicago, go by bus.</li> <li>*シカゴへ行ったらバスで行きなさい。</li> </ul>  (In this case, なら is used. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ なら\">なら</a>))  2. In Sentence1たらSentence2, it is often the case that Sentence1 represents a condition and Sentence2 an event which occurs under that condition. Therefore, the whole sentence basically means 'when Sentence1 is satisfied, Sentence2 takes place' or 'Sentence1 brings about Sentence2', as in Examples (c), (d) and (e).  3. As seen in Key Sentence, たら may mean 'when' in one case and 'if' in another. たら means 'when' if Sentence1 is a certainty; if not, たら means 'if'. Thus, in (3), たら means 'when'.  <ul>(3) <li>十二時になったら帰ります。</li> <li>When/*If it is twelve o'clock, I'll go home.</li> </ul>  もし before Sentence1たら makes sentences unambiguous; it always means 'if Sentence1'. Example:  <ul>(4) <li>もし山田さんが来たら私は帰ります。</li> <li>If/*When Mr. Yamada comes, I'll go home.</li> </ul>  4. In Sentence1たらSentence2, Sentence2 can be a command, a request, a suggestion, an invitation or a volitional sentence.  <ul>(5)</ul>  <table class=\"table\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\">⎧a. 来なさい。</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\">⎪b. 来てください。</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">仕事が早く終わっらた僕のうちに</td> <td class=\"td\">⎨c. 来たらどうですか。</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\">⎩d. 来ませんか。</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table class=\"table\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\">⎧a. come to my place.</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\">⎪b. please come to my place.</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">If you finish your work early, </td> <td class=\"td\">⎨c. why don't you come to my place?</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\">⎩d. wouldn't you like to come to my place?</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <ul>(6)  <li>仕事が早く終わったらおうちにお伺いします。</li> <li>If I finish my work early, I'll visit your place.</li> </ul>  5. Sentence1たらSentence2 can also be used in counterfactual situations, as in (7).  <ul>(7) <li>a. お金があったらこんなうちにはいない。</li> <li>If I had money, I wouldn't be in such a house.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.あの時お金があったら日本へ行っていたでしょう。</li> <li>If I had had money at that time, I would probably have gone to Japan.</li> </ul>  6. When Sentence2 in \"Sentence1たらSentence2\" represents a past action, the action cannot be one intentionally taken by the agent after the action or event represented by Sentence1. Thus, the (a) sentences in (8) and (9) are acceptable, but the (b) sentences are not.  <ul>(8) <li>a. 学校へ行ったら、偶然上田さんに会った。</li> <li>When I went to school, I happened to see Mr. Ueda.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *学校へ行ったら、上田さんと話をした。</li> <li>When I went to school, I talked with Mr. Ueda.</li> </ul>  <ul>(9)  <li>a. お酒を飲んだら寝てしまった。</li> <li>After I drank sake, I fell asleep.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *お酒を飲んだら寝た。</li> <li>After I drank sake, I went to bed.</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  ば, なら and と4 have similar functions but they are different trom たら in the following ways:  I. In Sentence1たらSentence2, if the event in Sentence1 precedes the event in Sentence2, those events can be past events. This is also the case with Sentence1とSentence2, but not with Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2, as in [1].  [1]  <ul> <li>a. 先生に聞いたら/聞くと/*聞けば/*聞いた(の)ならすぐ分かった。</li> <li>When I asked my teacher, I understood it immediately.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.キャシーのアパートに行ったら/行くと/*行けば/*行った(の)ならアンデイーがいた。</li> <li>When I went to Cathy's apartment, Andy was there.</li> </ul>  II. As stated in Note 4, Sentence2 in Sentence1たらSentence2 can be a command, a request, a suggestion, an invitation or a volitional sentence. This is also the case with Sentence2 in Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2 but not with Sentence2 in Sentence1とSentence2. Example:  [2]  <ul> <li>問安かったら/安ければ/安い(の)なら/*安いと買いなさい。</li> <li>Buy it, if it's cheap.</li> </ul>  II. Although Sentence2 in Sentence1たらSentence2, Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2 can be a command a request, a suggestion, an invitation or a volitional sentence, the meanings are not exactly the same. The following examples show the differences clearly.  [3]  <ul> <li>a. ベンが来たら、私は帰ります。</li> <li>When/If Ben comes, I'll go home.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ベンがくれば、私は帰ります。</li> <li>If Ben comes, I'll go home. (If not, I'll stay here.)</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. ベンが来る(の)なら、私は帰ります。</li> <li>It it is true that Ben is coming, I'll go home.</li> </ul>  As seen above, [3a] is ambiguous; it is not clear that Ben is coming. If Ben's coming is certain, [3a] indicates the time the speaker will leave. If Ben's coining is uncertain, [3a] indicates the condition under which the speaker will leave. In both cases, however, Ben's coming precedes the speaker's leaving. [3b] is similar to the second case of [3a] (i.e., the case in which Ben's coming is uncertain). However, [3b] focuses more on the condition. That is, [3b] implies something like 'the condition under which I go home is Ben's coming here'. In [3b] also, Ben's coming precedes the speaker's leaving. Sentence1 in [3c] also indicates the condition under which the speaker returns home. In this case, however, Ben's coming does not necessarily precede the speaker's leaving because the condition under which the speaker goes home is that Ben's coming !s true, not that Ben comes (to a certain place).  IV. As stated in Note 5, Sentence1たらSentence2 can be used in counterfactual situations, and so can Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2. However, Sentence1とSentence2 cannot be used in such situations except for the idiomatic expression Sentenceといい/よかった 'It would be good/It would have been good if Sentence'. Example:  [4]  <ul> <li>あの時お金があったら/あれば/あったなら/*あると日本に行っていただろう。</li> <li>If I had had money at that time, I would have gone to Japan.</li> </ul>","type":"Conjunction","relatedExpression":["ば"," なら"," と4"," 時"]},{"﻿title":"なら","description":"A conjunction which indicates that the preceding sentence is the speaker’s supposition about the truth of a present or past fact or the actualisation of something in the future.","englishEquivalent":"If it is true that; if it is the case that; if; would; could","textInfo":"1. Basically, Sentenceなら expresses the speaker's supposition concerning the truth of a present or past fact or the actualization of something in the future.  2. なら is the simplified form of ならば, the conditional form of the copula だ. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ ば\">ば</a>) In modern Japanese, however, ば is usually omitted.  3. Since なら is the simplified conditional form of the copula, it requires a noun or a noun equivalent. Thus, if the preceding element is not a noun, it is nominalized by の (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ の (3)\">の3</a>), although this の is optional in modern Japanese. (The stems of な type adjectives behave like nouns; therefore, they can precede なら without being nominalized. See Formation (ii).)  4. When Sentence1 is nonpast, Sentence1ならSentence2 cannot be used if it is nonsensical to suppose the truth of Sentence. Thus, the sentences in (1) - (3) are all unacceptable. (1) is unacceptable because it never fails to become ten o'clock; (2) is unacceptable because one can never tell whether it is true or not that it will rain tomorrow; (3) is unacceptable because the speaker already knows it is true that he wants to go.  <ul>(1) <li>*十時になるならバスが来るはずです。</li> <li>Lit. The bus is expected to come if it is true that it becomes ten o'clock.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2)  <li>*あした雨が降るなら試合はないでしょう。</li> <li>If it is true that it will rain tomorrow, there will probably be no game.</li> </ul>  <ul>(3) <li>*僕が行きたいなら、和子も行きたがっているはずです。</li> <li>If it is true that I want to go, I expect that Kazuko also wants to go.</li> </ul>  As seen above, なら cannot be used (A) if Sentence1 never fails to happen, (B) if one can never tell if it is true or not that Sentence1 will happen, or (C) if the speaker already knows Sentence1 is the fact. If Sentence1 is counterfactual, Sentence1ならSentence2 can be used. For example, (4) is acceptable because Sentence1 expresses the speaker's counterfactual feeling.  Note that in this case the nominalizer の is preferred.  <ul>(4) <li>僕が行きたいのならだれにも言わずに一人で行くよ。</li> <li>It it were the case that I wanted to go, I would go by myself without telling anybody.</li> </ul>  5. Sentence1ならSentence2 cannot be used if the completion or actualization of Sentence1 brings about Sentence2.  <ul>(5) <li>*春子のアパートへ行く/行ったなら一郎がいた。</li> <li>When I went to Haruko's apartment, Ichiro was there.</li> </ul>  <ul>(6) <li>*テープレコーダーを買う/買ったならテープをくれた。</li> <li>When I bought a tape-recorder, they gave me a tape.</li> </ul>  If Sentence2 does not express a past event or a present habitual events but expresses a present state, the speaker's opinion, volition, judgment, command, request or suggestion, Sentence1なら can be used as in (7).  (7)  <ul>[Opinion] <li>a. ニューヨークへ行く(の)ならリンカーン・センターがおもしろいですよ。</li> <li>If you go to New York, Lincoln Center is interesting.</li> </ul>  <ul>[Volition] <li>b. ニューヨークへ行く(の)ならリンカーン・センターへ行きます。</li> <li>If I go to New York, I will go to Lincoln Center.</li> </ul>  <ul>[Judgment] <li>c. テープレコーダーを買う/買ったならテープをくれるはずです。</li> <li>If you buy/have bought a tape-recorder, they should give you a tape.</li> </ul>  6. When Sentence2 in Sentence1ならSentence2 is past, Sentence1 must be a past event or state. For example, in (8), Sentence1 represents a past event, and Sentence1なら indicates that the speaker supposes the truth of Sentence1.  <ul>(8) <li>雨が降った(の)なら試合はなかったはずです。</li> <li>If it is true that it rained, there should have been no game.</li> </ul>  (8) can also be used in a counterfactual situation where it means 'If it were true that it rained, there should have been no game.'

When these two expressions are used in the past tense, however, their meanings are not the same. For example, [1a] means that Mr. Brown did put on Tom's undershirt, whereas [1b] means that Mr. Brown tried to put it on, with the implication that he couldn't or didn't actually do it.

Verbてしまう often appears with such adverbs as すっかり 'completely', 全部 'all' and 完全に 'completely. Examples:  <ul>(1) <li>a. マイクはすっかり日本語を忘れてしまった。</li> <li>Mike has completely forgotten Japanese.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私は持っていた切手を全部友達にあげてしまった。</li> <li>I gave all the stamps I had kept to my friends.</li> </ul>  2. Verbてしまった also expresses the idea that someone did something which he shouldn't have done or something happened which shouldn't have happened. (Key Sentence (B) and Example (d)) Thus, it often implies the agents regret about what he has done or the speaker's regret or criticism about someone's action or about something that has happened. Examples:  <ul>(2) <li>a. ジェリーはペギーのケーキを食べてしまった。</li> <li>Jerry (mistakenly) ate Peggy's cake.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私はちがうバスに乗ってしまった。</li> <li>I got on the wrong bus.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. 雨が降ってしまったのでピクニックに行けなかった。</li> <li>It rained, so we couldn't go on a picnic.</li> </ul>  3. Whether a sentence with Verbてしまった is interpreted as simple completion or regret (or criticism) depends on the context and/or the situation. For example, (3) can be interpreted in two ways.  <ul>(3) <li>僕はお酒を飲んでしまった。</li> <li>(A) I finished drinking sake. </li> <li>(B) I drank sake (which I shouldn't have done).</li> </ul>  4. てしまう and でしまう are contractea as ちゃう and じゃう respectively, in informal speech, as in (4), and can be used by male and by female speakers.  <ul>(4) <li>a. 話してしまう&nbsp;&nbsp;→&nbsp;&nbsp;話しちやう&nbsp;&nbsp;have talked</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 飲んでしまう&nbsp;&nbsp;→&nbsp;&nbsp;飲んじやう&nbsp;&nbsp;have drunk</li> </ul>  ちまう and じまう, another set of contracted forms of てしまう, are used only by male speakers.  【Related Expressions】  I. Verb past can also express the completion of an action. However, it is different from Verbてしまう in that Verb past expresses the completion of an action in the past, while Verbてしまう expresses completion regardless of the time of completion. Thus, [1a] is grammatical, but [1b] is not.  [1]  <ul> <li>a. ここにおいておくとジムが食べてしまうよ。</li> <li>If you leave it here, Jim will eat it (up).</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ここにおいておくとジムが食べたよ。</li> <li>If you leave it here, Jim will eat it up.</li> </ul>  II. Verbます終わる also means 'finish doing ~'. The difference between Verbます終わる and Verbてしまう is that Verbます終わる indicates the action of finishing something, while Verbてしまう indicates the completed state of the action. Thus, these two expressions correspond to the English expressions 'finish doing' and 'have done' in that Verbます終わる can occur with a specific time phrase, but Verbてしまう cannot.  [2]  <ul> <li>a. きのうその本を読み終わった/*読んでしまった。</li> <li>I finished reading/*have read the book yesterday.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. けさ九時にやっとレポートを書き終わった/*書いてしまった。</li> <li>I finally finished writing/*have finally written the report at nine o'clock this morning.</li> </ul>  It is also noted that しまう can be used with noncontrollable verbs like 忘れる 'forget', while 終わる cannot, as in [3].  [3]  <ul> <li>a. 僕はナンシーの住所を忘れてしまった。</li> <li>I've forgotten Nancy's address.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *僕はナンシーの住所を忘れ終わった。</li> <li>*I finished forgetting Nancy's address.</li> </ul>","type":"Auxiliary Verb (Group 1)","relatedExpression":["【Related Expression:~終わる"]},{"﻿title":"おく","description":"Do something in advance for future convenience.","englishEquivalent":"Do something in advance; go ahead and do something; let someone/something remain as he/it is","textInfo":"1. おく as a main verb means 'put' or 'place'. However, when it is used with Verbて, it is an auxiliary verb meaning 'do something in advance and leave the resultant state as it is for future convenience'.  2. With a causative verb, Verbておく can express the idea that someone lets someone or something remain in his/its present state. Examples:  <ul>(1) <li>a. 信子は疲れているからしばらく寝させておこう。</li> <li>Since Nobuko is tired, let's let her sleep for a while.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.飲みたいと言うのなら好きなだけ飲ませておきなさい。</li> <li>If he says he wants to drink, let him drink as much as he likes.</li> </ul>  However, if the context is not clear, causative Verbておく can be ambiguous.

Therefore, if the first person or a person the speaker empathizes with is a recipient in a あげる sentences, a viewpoint conflict arises, making the sentences ungrammatical.

What he has heard is especially important. Unlike そうだ2, which expresses a simple guess based on what the speaker sees, らしい is used when the conjecture is based on more reliable information. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ そうだ (2)\">そうだ2</a>) (For a comprehensive comparison of conjecture expressions, see (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ ようだ\">ようだ</a>, Related Expressions.)  2. If there has been relatively little conjecture in the speaker's mind, らしい is almost the same as the hearsay expression そうだ1.   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ そうだ (1)\">そうだ1</a>)  3. Negative conjecture is expressed by a negative predicate and らしい, as in (1).  <ul>(1) <li>a. 田口さんはパーティーに行かないらしい。</li> <li>It seems that Mr. Taguchi won't go to the party.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. メアリーはビルが好きじゃないらしい。</li> <li>It seems that Mary doesn't like Bill.</li> </ul>  4. Another use of らしい is as follows:  <ul>(2) <li>大木さんは男らしい。</li> <li>Mr. Oki is manly.</li> </ul>  Here, らしい means likeness. That is, \"XはYらしい\" means that X is like the ideal model of Y. (Of course, (2) can also mean \"It seems that Oki is a man.\")  5. Since らしい is an い type adjective, it can also precede nouns, as in (3).  <ul>(3) <li>私は男らしい人が好きだ。</li> <li>I like a manly man.</li> </ul>  The negative version of (2) is (4).  <ul>(4) <li>大木さんは男らしくない。</li> <li>Mr. Oki is not manly.</li> </ul>  If 大木さんは男(だ) is negated, the meaning changes.  <ul>(5) <li>大木さんは男じやないらしい。</li> <li>It seems that Oki is not a man.</li> </ul>","type":"Auxiliary Adjective (い)","relatedExpression":["ようだ (だろう"," そうだ2)"]},{"﻿title":"ように (1)","description":"Do something in such a way that ~.","englishEquivalent":"So that","textInfo":"1.

The particle used with the noun or noun phrase between のは and だ usually drops if the particle does not have any concrete meaning (as in the cases of が and を), or if the meaning of the entire sentence is somehow predictable. Examples follow.  <ul>(1) <li>八時にうちに来たのは森田さん(*が)だ。</li> <li>It was Mr. Morita who came to my house at eight o'clock.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>森田さんが持って来たのはケーキ(*を)だ。</li> <li>It was cake that Mr. Morita brought here.</li> </ul>  <ul>(3) <li>森田さんがケーキをくれたのは弟(に)だ。</li> <li>It was to my brother that Mr. Morita gave cake.</li> </ul>  <ul>(4) <li>森田さんがうちに来たのは車でだ。</li> <li>It was by his car that Mr. Morita came to my house.</li> </ul>  <ul>(5) <li>a. 森田さんが来たのは東京からだ。</li> <li>It was from Tokyo that Mr. Morita came.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 森田さんが出発したのは東京(から)だ。</li> <li>It was from Tokyo that Mr. Morita departed.</li> </ul>  <ul>(6) <li>a. 森田さんが飲んだのは田山さんとだ。</li> <li>It was with Mr. Tayama that Mr. Morita drank.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 森田さんが一緒に飲んだのは田山さん(と)だ。</li> <li>It was with Mr. Tayama that Mr. Morita (literally: together drank.)</li> </ul>  In (5b) and (6b) the particles から and と normally drop, because 出発した 'departed' and 一緒に 'together' generally co-occur with から and と, respectively.  3. The element between のは and だ cannot be a manner adverb. The following sentences are all unacceptable.  <ul>(7) <li>*花子が歩いたのはゆっくりだ。</li> <li>*It was slowly that Hanako walked.</li> </ul>  <ul>(8) <li>*太郎が字を書いたのはきれいにだ。</li> <li>*It was beautifully that Taro wrote characters.</li> </ul>  Unlike English, the copula だ in this construction is normally in the present tense.  <ul>(9) <li>きのう買ったのはステレオです/???でした。</li> <li>It was a stereo set that I bought yesterday.</li> </ul>  5. The number of のは~だ sentences which can be produced from one sentence is limited only by the number of elements which can be placed between のは and だ. For example, four such sentences can be derived from (10).  <ul>(10) <li>ジョンがジェーンに東京で八月に会った。</li> <li>John met Jane in August in Tokyo.</li> </ul>  <ul>(11) <li>a. ジェーンに東京で八月に会ったのはジョンだ。</li> <li>It was John who met Jane in August in Tokyo.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ジョンが東京で八月に会ったのはジェーンだ。</li> <li>It was Jane whom John met in August in Tokyo.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. ジョンがジェーンに八月に会ったのは東京(で)だ。</li> <li>It was in Tokyo that John met Jane in August.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>d. ジョンがジェーンに東京で会ったのは八月だ。</li> <li>It was in August that John met Jane in Tokyo.</li> </ul>  6. Normally the の clause takes は, marking the entire clause as presupposed, old, unimportant information, and the element between のは and だ represents a new, important piece of information. But sometimes the の clause takes が, marking the clause as new, important information. In this case the element between のが and だ indicates unimportant information.  <ul>(12) <li>私が作っているのがロボットです。</li> <li>The one I'm making is a robot.</li> </ul>  <ul>[Complementiser phrase]  <li>ロボットは私が作っています。</li> <li>Speaking of robots, I'm making one.</li> </ul>  【Related Expression】  の in the present construction should not be confused with the の used as a nominalizer. Sentence [1] is the のは~だ construction and [2], the nominalized sentence.  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ の (3)\">の3</a>)  [1]  <ul> <li>本を読むのはたいてい夜だ。</li> <li>It is usually at night that I read books.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>本を読むのはいいことだ。</li> <li>It is a good thing to read books.</li> </ul>  One way to differentiate between the two constructions is to see if the sentence can be restated by deleting のは and だ and placing the element before のは in an appropriate position. For example, [1] can be restated as [3], but [2] cannot be restated, as seen in [4].  [3]  <ul> <li>たいてい夜本を読む。</li> <li>I read books usually at night.</li> </ul>  [4]  <ul> <li>a. *いいこと本を読む。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *本をいいこと読む。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. *本を読むいいこと。</li> </ul>","type":"Structure","relatedExpression":["の3"]},{"﻿title":"さ","description":"A suffix that makes a noun out of an adjective by attaching it to the stem of an Adj (い) or much less frequently to the stem of an Adj (な)","englishEquivalent":"-ness; -ly","textInfo":"1. The suffix さ is a very productive suffix that makes a noun out of an adjective.

Adjective な stem+さ is not commonly used. It is suggested that the learner avoid using it. Some of the most commonly used Adjective な stem+さ are the following:  <ul> <li>便利さ&nbsp;&nbsp;convenience</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div>  <li>正確さ&nbsp;&nbsp;accuracy</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>忠実さ&nbsp;&nbsp;loyalty</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>完璧さ&nbsp;&nbsp;perfection</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>のどかさ&nbsp;&nbsp;calmness</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div>  <li>にぎやかさ&nbsp;&nbsp;liveliness</li> </ul>  3. When an adjective can be paired with another adjectival antonym as in 大きい 'big' vs. 小さい 'small', the positive counterparty (i.e., 大きい) tends to acquire a meaning of absolute degree when さ is attached, as in 大きさ 'size'. Examples follow:  <table class=\"table\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">Positive</td> <td class=\"td\"></td> <td class=\"td\">Negative</td> <td class=\"td\"></td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">厚さ</td> <td class=\"td\">breadth</td> <td class=\"td\">薄さ</td> <td class=\"td\">thinness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">重さ</td> <td class=\"td\">weight</td> <td class=\"td\">軽さ</td> <td class=\"td\">lightness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">難しさ</td> <td class=\"td\">difficulty</td> <td class=\"td\">やさしさ</td> <td class=\"td\">easiness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">うれしさ</td> <td class=\"td\">joy</td> <td class=\"td\">悲しさ</td> <td class=\"td\">sadness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">深さ</td> <td class=\"td\">depth</td> <td class=\"td\">浅さ</td> <td class=\"td\">shallowness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">高さ</td> <td class=\"td\">height</td> <td class=\"td\">低さ</td> <td class=\"td\">lowness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">暑さ</td> <td class=\"td\">heat</td> <td class=\"td\">寒さ</td> <td class=\"td\">coldness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">濃さ</td> <td class=\"td\">density</td> <td class=\"td\">薄さ</td> <td class=\"td\">thinness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">大きさ</td> <td class=\"td\">size</td> <td class=\"td\">小ささ</td> <td class=\"td\">smallness</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">広さ</td> <td class=\"td\">size of space</td> <td class=\"td\">狭さ</td> <td class=\"td\">smallness of space</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">強さ</td> <td class=\"td\">strength</td> <td class=\"td\">弱さ</td> <td class=\"td\">weakness</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  【Related Expression】  さ describes, in an analytical manner, the degree of the state represented by an adjective, but み, another noun-forming suffix, is a more emotive and concrete characterization of some state (based primarily on direct perception). Only a limited number of Adjective い can be used with み. Examples:  <ul> <li>赤み&nbsp;&nbsp;reddishness</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>悲しみ&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrow</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>暖かみ&nbsp;&nbsp;warmness</li>  <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>深み&nbsp;&nbsp;depth</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>厚み&nbsp;&nbsp;thickness</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>弱み&nbsp;&nbsp;weakness</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>甘み&nbsp;&nbsp;sweetness</li>  <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>苦み&nbsp;&nbsp;bitterness</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>苦しみ&nbsp;&nbsp;painfulness</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div>  <li>強み&nbsp;&nbsp;strength</li> </ul>  Consider the following sentences in which さ is unacceptable.

However, が is much weaker than 'but' in that it is sometimes used simply to combine two sentences for stylistic reasons even if those two sentences do not represent contrastive ideas. For example, the が in (1) is used simply as a transition word to connect two sentences.  <ul>(1) <li>a. パーティーをしますが来ませんか。</li> <li>We'll have a party. Wouldn't you like to come?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 田中さんは私のうちにも時々来ますがおもしろい人ですね。</li> <li>Mr. Tanaka sometimes comes to my place, too. He is an interesting person, isn't he?</li> </ul>  2. が2 makes a sentence unit with the preceding sentence, not with the following sentence. Thus, it is wrong to place a comma before が or to start a sentence with が, as in (2) and (3).  <ul>(2) <li>*ジョンは来た，がメアリーは来なかった。</li> <li>John came, but Mary didn't come.</li> </ul>  <ul>(3) <li>*ジョンは来た。がメアリーは来なかった。</li> <li>John came. But Mary didn't come.</li> </ul>  3. Sentence1 and Sentence2 in \"Sentence1がSentence2\" must be in the same form whether formal or informal, because they are both independent clauses. (4) and (5) are stylistically awkward.

Sentence2 in \"Sentence1がSentence2\" is often omitted when it is understandable from the context and/or the situation, or when the speaker doesn't want to continue for some reason (e.g., the sentence is too direct, impolite, embarrassing，etc.). Examples:  <ul>(6) <li>大じょうぶだと思いますが。</li> <li>I think it's all right but...</li> </ul>  <ul>(7) <li>トムはよく勉強するんですが。</li> <li>Tom studies hard but...</li> </ul>  5.

When Verb informal past precedes ばかり, the whole expression means that there has been almost no time for anything to happen since what is stated took place.

Politeness is expressed in this form by two elements: first by the polite prefix お, and second by the verb なる which describes someone's action or state indirectly. This indirectness is a common strategy in polite expressions.  2. There are some verbs whose honorific forms are expressed by special honorific verbs.  3. When a verb has the form \"Nounする\" like 結婚 'marry' and 電話する 'call' its honorific form is \"ご/おNounなさる\". なさる is the honorific form of する 'do' and a Group 1 verb.

Thus, the following sentence is unacceptable.  <ul>(1) <li>*森さんはワープロを買おうと思う/思います。</li> </ul>  The reason why (1) is unacceptable is that 思う represents an internal feeling of the speaker alone. Therefore, when the subject is the third person, 思う has to be replaced by the stative 思っている which means 'he (= the third person subject) has indicated that he feels ~, in such a way that the speaker can see and/or hear what he feels'. Observe the following sentence.  <ul>(2) <li>私/*父/*山下さんはその映画を見ようと思います。</li> <li>I/My father/Mr. Yamashita think(s) I/he will see that movie.</li> </ul>  It is also to be noted that ようと思う cannot be used as a question.  <ul>(3) <li>??あの本を読もうと思いますか。</li> <li>Do you think you will read that book?</li> </ul>  2. The negative version of ようと思う is Verb informal nonpast まいと思う, as seen in Key Sentence B and Example (c).  3.

Because the main verbs used in the Key Sentences and the Examples, such as 悲しむ 'sadden', 喜ぶ 'rejoice', 恐れる 'fear', 懐かしむ nostalgically recollect' and 悩む 'worry' are all inwardly-oriented psychological verbs they cannot be considered transitive verbs in Japanese. Therefore, the particle を4 preceding these verbs cannot be the ordinary direct object marker を which normally marks an outwardly-oriented event. Rather it indicates the cause for human emotion expressed by the main verb. Thus, it is sometimes possible to rewrite the sentence in question using ので 'because'. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ ので\">ので</a>) For example, Key Sentence (A) and Example (a) can be paraphrased as (1a) and (1b), respectively.  <ul>(1) <li>a. 次郞は父が死んだので悲しんだ。</li> <li>Jiro was sad because his father died.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私は浩が大学に入学したので喜んだ。</li> <li>I was glad because Hiroshi entered college.</li> </ul>  The original versions are examples of written style and are seldom used in conversational Japanese, but the rewritten versions can be used in both spoken and written Japanese.  2. No matter what person (first, second, third) the subject of this construction is, the main emotive verb is normally in the stative ているい/ない form and/or in the past tense. In a generic statement, however, the verb can be in the non-stative, nonpast form as in (2):  <ul>(2) <li>誰でも親の死を悲しむ。</li> <li>Everybody is saddened by their parents' death.</li> </ul>  3. If the emotive verb consists of adjective い stem + suffixむ as in 悲しむ 'sadden', 懐かしむ 'nostalgically recollect', 惜しむ 'regret', 楽しむ 'enjoy', it can take the suffix がる 'show signs of ~' as in 悲しがる, 懐かしがる, 惜しがる and 楽しがる. Thus, along with Key Sentence (A) we have a sentence type (3).   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ がる\">がる</a>)  <ul>(3) <li>次郞は父の死を悲しがった。</li> <li>Jiro showed signs of being sad about his father's death.</li> </ul>  (3) is a more objective expression than Key Sentence (A), because the verb がる 'show signs of ~' has an outwardly-oriented meaning.","type":"Particle","relatedExpression":[""]},{"﻿title":"に (3)","description":"A particle that indicates an agent or a source in passive, causative, もらう/てまらう and other receiving constructions.","englishEquivalent":"By; from","textInfo":"1. に3 is typically used in passive, causative, もらう/てもらう constructions and with verbs such as 借りる 'borrow', 聞く 'hear', もらう 'receive', 習う 'learn', 教わる 'learn' which require a noun phrase representing the source of the direct object.

A noun that precedes で3 expresses something that is beyond human control (such as illness, flood, accident, rain, and fire). It is also to be noted that で3 co-occurs with any noun, if a predicate expresses something that is beyond human control.

The verb before 間 is normally nonpast Vている or いる regardless of the tense of the main clause.  3. 間, if followed by に, a particle of specific time point, means that the time span of an event identified by the main clause falls within the time span of an event identified by the 間-clause, as in Exs.

The sentence-final やはり as in (1c) sounds like an after-thought, and its usage is slightly marginal.  3. やっぱり is a more emphatic and emotive version of やはり, owing to its glottal stop 'っぱ'.  【Related Expressions】  I. さすが is an adverb/adjective な whose meaning is similar to やはり. さすが, however, has only one meaning 'as expected' and indicates that the speaker is very much impressed or surprised by the given situation.

II. The adverb 結局 'after all, in short' can replace やはり only when the latter means 'after all', as in Example (d). More examples follow:  [2]  <ul> <li>a. 色々薬を飲んだがやはリ/結局治らなかった。</li> <li>I took all kinds of medicine, but I wasn't cured.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.やはリ/結局行かないことにした。</li> <li>After all, I decided not to go there.</li> </ul>  In [2] 結局 sounds more formal than やはり, because the former is a Sino-Japanese word, while the latter is a Japanese word.

Thus, it can function as the subject, as in Key Sentence or Examples (a) and (e), or as the direct object, as in Examples (b) and (d), and so on.  【Related Expression】  In contrast to another nominalizer の, こと tends to indicate something the speaker does not feel close to. Thus, in Key Sentence, the nominalizer こと indicates that the speaker of the sentence is not personally involved in writing a novel; in other words, he is stating the sentence in general or objective terms.

When there is no subject in a ば cause sentence, the first person is the implicit subject.  3. This expression is often used with exclamatory words such as ああ 'oh' and the sentence-final particle of exclamation なあ, as in Example (c).  4. \"Someone (other than the first person) wishes ~ had done something\" is expressed using this phrase and the verb 思う 'think', as in (1).

In the \"Sentence1ほうがSentence2より\" pattern (Key Senetnce (B)), Sentence1 can be either nonpast or past. Sentence2, however, is always nonpast regardless of the tense of Sentence1 and the main clause. There are two cases in which Sentence1 is past. First, Senence1 can be past when the whole sentence is about a present or future action or state. In this case, the sentence sounds rather hypothetical. Example:  <ul>(2) <li>私が話したほうが君が話すよりいいでしょう。</li> <li>It would probably be better if I talk rather than if you talk.</li> </ul>  Sentence1 can also be past if the whole sentence is about a past action or state, in this case the sentence is counterfactual. Example:  <ul>(3) <li>私が話したほうが君が話すよりよかった。</li> <li>It would have been better if I had talked rather than you.</li> </ul>  3. Yより can precede X(の)ほうが, as in (4).  <ul>(4) <li>あのカメラよりこのカメラのほうが好きです。</li> <li>I like this camera better than that camera.</li> </ul>  4. Xのほう is a noun phrase; therefore, it can also be a direct object, an indirect object, etc. However, when it is used for something other than the subject, the \"YよりXのほう(を, に, etc.)\" order is preferable.

Example:  <ul>(4) <li>ビールを三本ほど飲みました。</li> <li>I drank about three bottles of beer.</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  ばかり and くらい also mean 'about' when they are used with a number and a counter.

Like sentences with もらう as a main verb, when the auxiliary verb もらう is used, the recipient of the favor (i.e., the person in the subject position) must be the first person or someone with whom the speaker empathizes (usually a member of the speaker's in-group). Thus, (1a) is grammatical, but (1b) is not.  <ul>(1) <li>a. 私は隣の人にペンを貸してもらった。</li> <li>Literally: I had the man next to me lend me a pen.

In both English and Japanese the subject of the 難い construction can be the subject of an intransitive verb, as in Example (a) where このドア 'this door' is the subject of 開く 'open'. It can also be the direct object of a transitive verb, as in Example (b) where あの人の名前 'his name' is the direct object of 覚える 'remember'. It can be the indirect object of a transitive verb, as in Example (c) where あの先生 'that teacher' is the indirect object of 話す 'talk'. Finally, the subject can be Noun+Particle such as この靴で 'with these shoes' corresponding in English to Preposition+Noun. In this construction, as in Examples (c) and (d), note that the preposition in the English sentence is retained but the corresponding particle in the Japanese sentence is deleted.  3. やすい 'easy to do ~' is an antonym of 難い.

Verbs like 歩く 'walk', 走る 'run' and 泳ぐ 'swim' are not considered motion verbs because they express a manner of movement rather than a movement from one place to another. Therefore, the following sentence is ungrammatical.  <ul>(1) <li>*私は桜の花を見に公園を歩いた。</li> <li>I walked through the park to see cherry blossoms.</li> </ul>  2. If the verb in Verbますに is a compound verb of the structure Nounする, such as 仕事する 'work', 勉強する 'study' and 質問する 'ask a question', する is sometimes omitted.  <ul>(2)  <li>a. 大山さんは仕事(し)に行った。</li> <li>Mr. Oyama went to work.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 学生が質問(し)に来た。</li> <li>A student came to ask questions.</li> </ul>  【Related Expression】  Verb informal nonpast為に is also used to express purpose in an action. However, the uses of Verb informal nonpast為に and Verbますに differ in some ways. First, unlike Verbますに, Verb informal nonpast為に can be used with any verb. Examples:  [1]  <ul> <li>私は子供の写真を撮るためにカメラを買った。</li> <li>I bought a camera to take pictures of my child.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>私はアメリカ人の友逹と話すために英語を勉強している。</li> <li>I'm studying English in order to speak with my American friend.</li> </ul>  Second, when Verbますに and Verb informal nonpast為に are used with verbs of motion, Verbますに can be used without a directional phrase, but Verb informal nonpast為に cannot, unless that information is clear from the context. Examples:   [3]  <ul> <li>僕は酒を飲みに行った。</li> <li>I went (somewhere) to drink.</li> </ul>  [4]  <ul> <li>a. 僕は酒を飲むために友達の家に行った。</li> <li>I went to his friend's house to drink.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *僕は酒を飲むために行った。</li> <li>I went to drink.</li> </ul>  Third, when Verb informal nonpast為に and Verbますに are used with verbs of motion, Verb informal nonpast為に usually expresses a rather important purpose, while Verbますに can be used even to express something insignificant. Examples:   [5]  <ul> <li>a. 喫茶店へコーヒーを飲みに行った。</li> <li>I went to a coffee shop to drink coffee.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ??喫茶店へコーヒーを飲むために行った。</li> <li>I went to a coffee shop to drink coffee.</li> </ul>","type":"Particle","relatedExpression":["為に"]},{"﻿title":"に (6)","description":"A particle which indicates the location where someone or something exists.","englishEquivalent":"In; at; on","textInfo":"1. に6 indicates the location where someone or something exists.

Noun phrases with に often occur as topics, as in Key Sentence (B) and Example (b).  4. If a location phrase which indicates the existence of someone or something modifies a noun phrase, as in 'an apartment in New York', に cannot be used. In this case, の is used.  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ の (1)\">の1</a>)  <ul>(1) <li>ニューヨークの/*にアパート</li> <li>an apartment in New York</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  I. で1 also indicates location, but not a location where someone/something exists.

In some sentences, both the locational に and the locational で can be used. For example, in [3] both に and で are appropriate.  [3]  <ul> <li>私は京都に/でいい家を見つけた。</li> <li>I found a good house in Kyoto.</li> </ul>  However, the nuances of a sentence with に and that with で are different. Namely, the sentence with に implies that \"I found a good house which is in Kyoto\", while the one with で means \"In Kyoto I found a good house\". Therefore, in [4] the に version and the で version mean different things.  [4]  <ul> <li>私は東京に/で仕事を見つけた。</li> <li>I found a job in Tokyo.</li> </ul>  Namely, in the sentence with に, the job is in Tokyo and the place the speaker found it mignt not have been Tokyo. On tne other hand, the sentence with で means that the place the speaker found the job was Tokyo and the place where he is going to work is not necessarily Tokyo.","type":"Particle","relatedExpression":["で1"," に4"]},{"﻿title":"られる (1)","description":"A state or an action cannot be controlled by someone or something.","englishEquivalent":"Be –ed; get –ed","textInfo":"1.There are two types of passive sentences in Japanese. One can be called \"direct passive\" and the other, \"indirect passive\". The direct passive is similar to the English passive. (Key Sentence (A), Examples (a) and (b)) That is, for every passive sentence, there is a corresponding active sentence. For example, the active version of Key Senence(A) is (1).  <ul>(1) <li>花子は一郎をだました。</li> <li>Hanako deceived Ichiro.</li> </ul>  As seen in Key Sentence (A), in direct passive sentences, the direct object in active sentences is presented as the subject; the subject in active sentences is presented as the agent and marked by に. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ に (3)\">に3</a>) Note that verbs in direct passive sentences are always transitive.  2. When the speaker uses a direct passive sentence, he is making a statement from the viewpoint of the receiver of the action. The agent is frequently omitted when he/it is not important and/or unknown, as in Examples (a) and (b).  3. The indirect object in active sentences can also be the subject in direct passive sentences. Examples:  <ul>(2)  <li>a. Active sentence</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>ジョンは先生に質問をした。</li> <li>John asked his teacher a question.</li>  <li>b. Direct passive sentence</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>先生はジョンに質問をされた。</li> <li>The teacher was asked a question by John.</li> </ul>  The agent in direct passive sentences can also be marked by other particles, such as によって and から.  <ul>(3) によって <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>a. この絵はピカソによってか描かれた。</li> <li>This picture was painted by Picasso.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 電話はベルによって発明された。</li> <li>The telephone was invented by Bell.</li> </ul>  によって, meaning 'depending on; owing to; by means of', is usually used in written form or formal speech when X in Xによって is a sort of medium through which or whom something is done. When によって is used, Xによって is usually under strong focus. Therefore, the following sentences are unacceptable under normal circumstances.  <ul>(4) <li>a. *私は花子によってぶ打たれた。</li> <li>I was hit by Hanako.</li>  <li>*川本さんはいつも仕事によって追われている。</li> <li>Mr. Kawamoto's work always keeps him busy.</li> </ul>  から 'from' can be used in place of に when the agent is a sort of source, that is, when there is something coming from the agent.  <ul>(5) から <li>a. 私は学生から日本の大学のことを聞かれた。</li> <li>I was asked by the students about Japanese universities.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 木田さんはみんなから尊敬されている。</li> <li>Mr. Kida is respected by everybody.</li> </ul>  The following sentences are unacceptable because the agents cannot be considered sources.  <ul>(6) <li>a. *その時計は泥棒から盗まれました。</li> <li>That watch was stolen by a thief.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *この写真は私の父から撮られたものです。</li> <li>This picture is the one taken by my father</li> </ul>  5. The other type of passive, the indirect passive, does not exist in English. The indirect passive is different from the direct passive and the English passive in the following ways:  <ul>(A) The verb can be intransitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Key Sentence (B), Example (c))</ul>  <ul>(B) The direct object can remain as the direct object.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Key Sentence (C), Example (d))</ul>  The indirect passive describes an event (X) involving an action by someone or something (Y) which affects another person (Z). As in direct passive sentences, the subject (Z) has no control over the event. Consider the following pair of sentences. (7a), a non-passive sentence, states simply that Taro drank Jiro's beer. (7b), an indirect passive sentence, however, expresses the idea that Jiro was affected by Taro's drinking beer. It implies that Jiro was annoyed in some way by Taro's action, perhaps because the beer Taro drank belonged to Jiro.  <ul>(7) <li>a.太郞は次郎のビールを飲んだ。</li> <li>Taro drank Jiro's beer.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.次郞は太郎にビールを飲まれた。</li> <li>Jiro was annoyed by Taro's drinking beer.</li> </ul>  6. In the indirect passive construction, Z is usually presented as the topic, marked by は, and Y as the agent, marked by に, as seen in Key Sentence (B) and Key Sentence (C).  7. Since in many situations X negatively affects Z, this construction is also referred to as \"adversity passive\" or \"suffering passive\". (Key Sentence (B), Key Sentence (C), Examples (c) and (d)) However, whether X affects Z negatively or positively depends on the situation. Z is not always a \"victim\", seen in (8) where Z is affected positively.  <ul>(8) <li>高山さんは美人に横に座られてニコニコしている。</li> <li>Literally: Mr. Takayama, having a pretty woman sit beside him, is smiling happily. (= A pretty woman sat beside Mr. Takayama and he is happy.))</li> </ul>  8. In indirect passive sentences, the agent must be marked by に. If a passive sentence contains an Noun Phrase に, as well as an agent marked by に, the agent must precede the Noun Phrase に. Example:  <ul>(9) <li>a. 私はトムにメアリーに電話された。</li> <li>Tom called Mary (and I was unhappy).</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *私はメアリーにトムに電話された。</li> <li>Tom called Mary (and I was unhappy).</li> </ul>  9. Passive verbs are also used as honorific expressions, as in Key Sentence (D) and Example (e), though the degree of politeness is lower than that of the \"おVerbますになる\" form and special honorific verbs. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ お～になる\">お~になる</a>) Politeness, in this case, is conveyed through the indirectness of the passive construction.  10. Passive verbs are all Group 2 verbs. The basic conjugations are as follows:  <ul>(10)</ul>  <table class=\"table\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">話される</td> <td class=\"td\">nonpast informal affirmative</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">話されない</td> <td class=\"td\">nonpast informal negative</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">話されて</td> <td class=\"td\">て form</td> </tr> <tr class=\"tr\"> <td class=\"td\">話された</td> <td class=\"td\">past informal affirmative</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  【Related Expression】  The potential form of Group 2 verbs is the same form as the passive form.(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ られる (2)\">られる2</a>) Potential, passive or honorific structures are identified through syntax and context. Examples:  [1]  <ul>[Potential] <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>先生は刺身が食べられる。</li> <li>My teacher can eat sashimi.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul>先生は刺身を食べられた。 <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>[Honorific] My teacher ate sashimi. </li> <li>[Potential] My teacher could eat sashimi. </li> <li>[Indirect passive] Someone ate sashimi and my teacher was unhappy.</li> </ul>  [3]  <ul>[Indirect passive] <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>先生は学生に刺身を食べられた。</li> <li>The teacher had (his) sashimi eaten by his students.</li> </ul>  As seen in [1], if the direct object is marked by が, 食べられる can only be interpreted as potential; if there is an agent marked by に, however, 食べられる expresses indirect passive, as seen in [3]. If there is no agent marked by に and the direct object is marked by を, 食べられる is ambiguous; it can be either honorific, potential or indirect passive, as seen in [2].","type":"Auxiliary Verb (Group 2)","relatedExpression":["お~になる"," られる2"]},{"﻿title":"しか","description":"A particle which marks an element X when nothing but X makes the expressed proposition true.","englishEquivalent":"Nothing/nobody/no ~ but; only","textInfo":"しか always occurs with negative predicates.  【Related Expressions】  I. だけ expresses a similar idea, (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ だけ\">だけ</a>) However, だけ and しか differ in the following ways:  (A) Xしか emphasizes the negative proposition of \"non-X\", while Xだけ merely describes the situation in neutral fashion.  (B) しか occurs only with negative predicates; だけ, however, can occur with affirmative predicates. Compare the following sentences:  [1]  <ul> <li>a. ボブだけ来た。</li> <li>Only Bob came.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ボブしか来なかった。</li> <li>Nobody but Bob came.</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>a. ボブだけ来なかった。</li> <li>Only Bob didn’t come.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *ボブしか来た/来なくなかった。</li> <li>Everybody but Bob came.</li> </ul>  (C) The verb かかる 'it takes (time)' can be used with しか, but not with だけ, as in [3].

(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ ばかり\">ばかり</a>) Unlike Xしか or Xだけ, however, Xばかり emphasizes the positive proposition of X, often with the implication that someone/something does something to X/with X/... a lot or more than one expects. For example, [4a] emphasizes the fact that Jim drank beer, whereas [4b] emphasizes the fact that Jim didn't drink anything but beer. [4c] is a neutral statement.  [4]  <ul> <li>a. ジムはビールばかリ飲んだ。</li> <li>Jim drank only beer (and a lot).</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ジムはビールしか飲まなかった。</li> <li>Jim drank nothing but beer.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>c. ジムはビールだけ飲んだ。</li> <li>Jim drank only beer.</li> </ul>  Note that Xばかり cannot be used if X is a single entity.

The conjunction とか is a combination of the quote marker と3 and か1. That is why とか is often followed by the verb 言う 'say', as in Example (a). When とか is followed by 言う, as in (1), it is not a conjunction; it is a quote marker. The か indicates the speaker's uncertainty about the quoted report.  <ul>(1) <li>佐藤さんは忙しくて行けないとか言っていた。</li> <li>Mr. Sato was saying he can't go there because he's busy or something.</li> </ul>  2. Noun1とか言うNoun2 meaning 'Noun2 that is called Noun1' is another example of とか used in the above sense.  <ul>(2) <li>野口とかいう人が来た。</li> <li>A person named Noguchi or something like that showed up.</li> </ul>  3. SentenceとかSentenceとかする is used when a statement refers to something in general rather than to something specific. Thus, this structure is inappropriate in (3).  (See Related Expression.)  <ul>(3) <li>A: ニューヨークではどんなことをしましたか。</li> <li>What sort of things did you do in New York?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>B: *ミュージカルを見るとか美術館に行くとかしました。</li> <li>I did things like watching musicals and visiting art museums.</li> </ul>  【Related Expression】  たり~たりする, like SentenceとかSentenceとかする, indicates an inexhaustive listing of examples. It differs from SentenceとかSentenceとかする, however, in that it can be used in both general and specific statements. As noted in Note 3, the とか construction can only be used in general statements. Thus, the grammatical version of (3B) is [1].  [1]  <ul> <li>ミュージカルを見たり美術館に行ったりしました。</li> </ul>  When たり~たりする indicates alternative actions or states, it cannot be replaced by とか.

But if a reporting verb 言う 'say' is used after って, then the sentence means 'The person (topic) says that ~'.  <ul>(1) <li>ジェーンは踊らないって言っているよ。</li> <li>Jane is saying that she won't dance.</li> </ul>  3. When って is not followed by a verb, the understood verb is 言う 'say'.

Example (c) is an ambiguous sentence, because 自分 can refer to either the main subject Michiko or to Kazuo. 自分's reference to Kazuo is not a counter example of 自分's strong tendency to refer to the subject, however, because Kazuo is semantically the subject of the verb 行く 'go'. Also to be noted is that Michiko is an agent of the causative action, but Kazuo is a passive experiencer of the causative action. Indeed，it is easier to look at Kazuo as the object of the speaker's empathy, because he is a passive experiencer.

The procedure for making relative clauses consists of several steps. The following steps show how to relativize ステーキ 'steak' in (1a) in order to obtain the clause modifying ステーキ in (1b).  <ul>(1) <li>a.ジョンはステーキを食べました。</li> <li>John ate a steak.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b.そのステーキは美味しかったです。</li> <li>the steak was delicious.</li> </ul>  Step 1: Delete the common noun phrase in the relative clause.

[See Formation.]  <ul>(4) <li>[ジョンは食べた]ステーキは美味しかったです。</li> </ul>  Step 4： If the topic marker は appears in the clause, replace it with the appropriate particle. (If は follows another particle, delete は.) In this example, ジョン is the subject; therefore, the particle which replaces は is the subject marker が.   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ が (1)\">が</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ は (1)\">は</a>)  <ul>(5) <li>[ジョンが食べた]ステーキは美味しかったです。</li> <li>The steak that John ate was delicious.</li> </ul>  The clause in brackets in (5) is the final form of the relative clause when ステーキ is relativized in (1a).  2. As seen in the procedure for relativization in Note 1,the relative clause construction in Japanese has several characteristics:  <ul> <li>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative clauses precede their corresponding relativized nouns.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no relative pronouns like 'which', 'that' and 'who' in English.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particles which were affixed to relativized nouns are deleted.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic marker は does not appear in relative clauses.</li> </ul>  3. の can also be used to mark the subject in relative clauses, as in (6).  <ul>(6) <li>ジョンが/の食べたステーキ</li> <li>the steak that John ate</li> </ul>  の cannot be used in place of が, however, if the subject of the sentence is followed by a noun, as in (7a). If の is used in this construction, the meaning of the sentence changes, as seen in (7b).  <ul>(7)  <li>a. トムがフットボールの切符をあげた女の子</li> <li>the girl to whom Tom gave a football ticket</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. トムのフットボールの切符をあげた女の子</li> <li>the girl to whom (someone) gave Tom's football ticket</li> </ul>  4. Besides the relative clause construction explained above, Japanese has a construction which looks similar to the one above. As seen in Note 1, in a genuine relative clause construction, the relativized noun (the head noun) is part of the original sentence from which the relative clause was derived. In this construction, however, the \"head noun\" is not part of the original sentence. For example, in (8), におい 'smell' is not part of the sentence 魚がこげる. 'Fish is burning.'  <ul>(8) <li>魚がこげるにおい。</li> <li>the smell of burning fish (literally: the smell which fish burns)</li> </ul>  The relationship between the \"relative clause\" and the \"head noun\", as seen in (8), is as follows: Suppose that X is the \"head noun\". Then, X is something which was brought about by the event expressed in the \"relative clause\", but is not something which was explicitly stated. For example, in (8) the \"head noun\" におい 'smell' is something brought about when fish burns, but is not an explicit part of the original sentence. Here are some more examples of this type of construction:  <ul>(9) <li>誰かが廊下を走る音</li> <li>the sound of someone's running in the hall</li> </ul>  <ul>(10) 紙をもやした煙</li> the smoke which came out when someone burned papers (literally: the smoke which someone burned papers)</li> </ul>  <ul>(11) <li>山に登った疲れ</li> <li>fatigue which was caused from climbing a mountain (literally: fatigue that (someone) climbed a mountain)</li> </ul>  5. The following examples are usually considered to be appositive clause constructions rather than relative clause constructions, because in these examples what is expressed by the preceding clause is the following noun itself.  <ul>(12) <li>日本へ行く計画/考え/予定/夢</li> <li>the plan/ dea/schedule/dream that (I am) going to Japan</li> </ul>  <ul>(13) <li>日本へ行った事実/経験/話/思い出</li> <li>the fact/experience/story/memory that (I) went to Japan</li> </ul>  6. In relative clauses in Japanese, the restrictive use and the non-restrictive use cannot be distinguished from the structure. It is usually determined from the context and/or the situation. The following examples are ambiguous.  <ul>(14) <li>私が日本語を教えてあげたブラウンさんはよく勉強する。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(A) Mr. Brown, to whom I taught Japanese, studies well.</li> <li>(B) (Among those Browns we know the) Mr. Brown to whom I taught Japanese studies well.</li> </ul>  <ul>(15) <li>よく働く日本人は嫌われる。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>(A) Japanese people, who work hard, are hated.</li> <li>(B) Japanese people who work hard are hated.</li> </ul>  7. The ease or relativization of a noun phrase differs depending on the particle marking the phrase. (16) shows the particle hierarchy. Here, noun phrases marked by the particles in the upper position are easy to relativize and noun phrases marked by the particles in the lower position are hard to relativize.  <ul>(16) <li>が>を1>に2>に6>を2>へ>で1>で2(means)>から1(source)>の1>から1(starting point)>と2>で(cause/reason)>より1</li> </ul>  Concerning the relativization of noun phrases in simple sentences, noun phrases marked by で2 (cause/reason) and より1 cannot be relativized, but those marked by the rest of the particles in (16) can.","type":"","relatedExpression":[""]},{"﻿title":"たり～たりする","description":"A phrase which expresses an inexhaustive listing of action or states.","englishEquivalent":"Do things like ~ and ~; sometimes ~ and sometimes ~","textInfo":"1.

(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ て\">て</a>))  (Complementiser phrase: <a href=\"#㊦ と (1)\">と1</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ や\">や</a>)  2. する usually follows \"XたりYたり\" regardless of the part of speech of X and Y, and expresses the tense, the aspect (e,g.,  progressive, perfect) and the formality level of the sentence.  3. This construction usually lists two actions or two states, but it can list more than two actions or two states, as in (1).  <ul>(1) <li>本を読んだり、映画を見たり、テープを間いたりして日本語を勉強している。</li> <li>I'm studying Japanese by doing things like reading books, seeing movies and listening to tapes.</li> </ul>  Sometimes only one action or state is listed in this construction, as in (2).  <ul>(2) <li>新聞を読んだりして友達が来るのを待っていた。</li> <li>I was waiting for my friend to come, doing things like reading a newspaper.</li> </ul>  4.

For the sentence (1) below, there are two honorific versions, depending on which part of Verbます始める is changed into an honorific form; if the Verbます is changed into an honorific form, it will become (2a) and if the entire Verbます始める is changed into an honorific form, it will become (2b).  <ul>(1) <li>先生は本を書きはじめた。</li> <li>The teacher began to write a book.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>a. 先生はご本をお書きになりはじめた。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 先生はご本をお書きはじめになった。</li> </ul>  (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ お～になる\">お~になる</a>)  3. 始める is normally attached to a non punctual verb (such as 読む 'read', 書く 'write' and 見る 'see'). If the subject is plural, however, the verb can be a punctual verb (such as 着く 'arrive', 来る 'come' and 死ぬ 'die').

(⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ にする\">にする</a>) The complexity is due to a noun phrase nominalized by こと. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ こと (2)\">こと2</a>) An example of Nounにする is given below:  <ul>(2) <li>A: 何にしますか。</li> <li>What are you going to have (literally: decide on)?</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>B: ハンバーガーにします。</li> <li>I'll have (literally: decide on) a hamburger.</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  I. ことにする indicates someone's volitional decision, whereas ことになる indicates a non-volitional decision. Therefore, if you perceive a given decision to be your own decision, you should use ことにする; on the other hand, if you don't perceive a given decision to be your own, you should use ことになる instead. That is why ことにする and ことになる are very awkward in [1a] and [1b], respectively.  [1]  <ul> <li>a. 私は大阪に転勤することになりました/???しました。</li> <li>Literally: It has been decided that I will transfer to Osaka.

The difference is that the former is an idiom and, therefore, frequently used in colloquial speech, while the latter is appropriate when the speaker is talking about a relatively important decision in a rather decisive manner. Also, ことにする can be used to mean 'I hereby decide to ~' but ことに決める cannot- Thus, [1] below cannot be rephrased by ことに決める.

Thus, [1] and [2] can take time expressions indicating the period of change, such as 一年のうちに 'within a year',  急に 'suddenly', とうとう 'finally', but [3] cannot. [1] is different from [2] in that the latter focuses on an indirect, circumstantial cause for the change, whereas the former focuses on a more direct one.

The idea that someone/something (= the causer) causes or allows someone/something (= the causee) to do something is expressed by the causative construction. In the causative construction, the causer is usually marked by は in main clauses and by が in subordinate clauses. When the main verb is an intransitive verb, the causee is marked by either を or に. The choice between the two particles depends on the following general rule. When に is used, the causee has taken an action intentionally. For example, に is ungrammatical in (1) because the causee didn't intend to go to the party in this situation.  <ul>(1) <li>父は私を/*にむりやりパーティ一へ行かせた。</li> <li>My father forced (literally: forcefully made) me to go to the party.</li> </ul>  Also, に is ungrammatical in (2) because the causee is a non-volitional entity and, therefore, has no intent (cannot take a volitional action).  <ul>(2) <li>私はハンカチを/*に湿らせた。</li> <li>Literally: I made my handkerchief get damp. (= I dampened my handkerchief.)</li> </ul>  を, on the other hand, can be used regardless of the causee's volition, as seen in (3) and (4). Whether a sentence expresses \"permissive\" causative or \"coercive\" causative depends on the context and/or the situation.  <ul>(3) <li>a. 私はいやがるむすこを/*にむりやり泳がせた。</li> <li>Literally: I forced my son, who resisted swimming, to swim.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私はむすこを/に好きなだけ泳がせた。</li> <li>I let my son swim as much as he wanted.</li> </ul>  <ul>(4) <li>a. 秋子は勉強はもうしたくないと言ったが私は彼女を/*に大学に行かせることにした。</li> <li>Akiko said she didn't want to study any more, but I've decided to send her to college, (literally: make her go to college.)</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 秋子はもっと勉強したいと言ったので, 私は彼女を/に大学に行かせることにした。</li> <li>Akiko said she wanted to study more, so I've decided to let her go to college.</li> </ul>  2. If the main verb is a transitive verb, the causee can be marked only by に as in (5), because を cannot appear more than once in a clause and, in this case, there is already a direct object marked by を in the clause. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ を (1)\">を1</a>)  <ul>(5) <li>一郎は雪子に/*をビールを飲ませた。</li> <li>Ichiro made (or let) Yukiko drink beer.</li> </ul>  Thus, when the verb is transitive, に is acceptable even if the causee is not willing to take the action.  <ul>(6) <li>—郎は雪子にむりやりビールを飲ませた。</li> <li>Ichiro forced Yukiko to drink beer.</li> </ul>  When the main verb is transitive, it is often difficult to tell from the sentence alone whether or not the causee takes the action willingly. This must be determined by the context and/or the situation in which the sentence is uttered.  3. Whether or not the causee is willing to do something is clear if one of the set of giving and receiving verbs is used. (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ あげる (2)\">あげる2</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ 呉れる・くれる (2)\">くれる2</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ もらう (2)\">もらう2</a>) Examples:  <ul>(7) <li>私は春子をパーティ一に行かせてやった。</li> <li>I let Haruko go to the party.</li> </ul>  <ul>(8) <li>父は私に酒を飲ませてくれた。</li> <li>My father let me drink sake.</li> </ul>  The causee's unwillingness to do something, on the other hand, can be more explicitly expressed by the causative-passive construction explained in Note 7.  4. In causative sentences, the causer must be equal to or higher than the causee in terms of status. Thus, the following is unacceptable:  <ul>(9) <li>*私は先生に/をパーティーに来させるつもりだ。</li> <li>I'm going to let (or make) my teacher come to the party.</li> </ul>  5. Causative verbs are all Group 2 verbs.

For example, in (12a) 食べさす means 'feed (with a spoon or something)' rather than 'make/let eat', while in (12b) 食べさせる is more general and means 'make/let eat (either by saying something like \"Eat your meal\" or \"You may eat your meal\" or actually by feeding with a spoon or sometning)'.  <ul>(12) <li>a. 私はジムに果物を食べさすつもりだ。</li> <li>I intend to feed Jim fruit.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 私はジムに果物を食べさせるつもりだ。</li> <li>I intend to make/let Jim eat fruit.</li> </ul>  7. Causative-passive verbs, which are used in causative-passive sentences, are constructed by affixing the passive verb ending られる to causative verb stems.

As seen in Key Sentence (A) - Key Sentence (D), verbs which precede ところ are either past or nonpast and either progressive or non-progressive, and each one of the four verb forms expresses a different aspect of the action.  3. As seen in Key Sentence (E), when the preceding verb is nonpast and non-progressive and the following copula is in the past tense, the sentence may mean 'someone or something almost did something.' (The literal meaning is 'someone or something was about to do something.') When ところだった means 'almost did something', such adverbs as もう少しで 'just by a little' and 危なく 'nearly' are often used also, as in Key Sentence (E) and Example (e).  4. ところ can be followed by either the copula, as in Key Sentence (A) - Key Sentence (E), Examples (a) and (e), or such particles as を, に, へ and で, as in Key Sentence (F) and Key Sentence (G), Examples (b) - (d) and (f) - (h).  5. When adjectives or nouns with の precede ところ, ところ is usually followed by a particle rather than the copula, as in Examples (f) and (h). The following sentences are ungrammatical:  <ul>(1) <li>a. *私は今忙しいところです。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. *私は今休みのところです。</li> </ul>  【Related Expressions】  I. When ところ is used as a dependent noun, its function appears to be similar to that of 時. However, these two expressions are different in that ところ basically indicates a state, while 時 indicates a time. Thus, [1] makes sense by itself, but [2] does not.  [1]  <ul> <li>僕は電話をかけるところだ。</li> <li>Literally: I'm in the state where I'm going to place a call. (= I'm just about to call someone.)</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>*僕は電話をかける時だ。</li> <li>*I am when I'm going to place a call.</li> </ul>  II. Verbいる/いたところだ is similar to Verbいる/いた. The difference is that the former focuses more on the state or the scene while the latter concentrates on the action. Compare the usages of the two expressions in [3] and [4].  [3]  <ul> <li>あ、ジョンが走っている/*走っているところだ。</li> <li>Look! John is running.</li> </ul>  [4]  <ul> <li>この写真は学生がフリスビーをしているところです/*しています。</li> <li>This picture shows students playing frisbee (literally: is a scene of students playing frisbee).</li> </ul>  III. Verb informal pastところだ is similar to Verb informal pastばかりだ. However, their implications are different. That is, the former indicates that someone/something is in the state of having just done something, while the latter implies that someone/something did something and not much time has passed since then. Thus, ところだ is strange in [5] because 一週間前 'a week ago' is too far in the past to be used to express \"have just done something\".

If the past tense is used, the sentence is ambiguous; it means either that a decision has been made but no action has been taken or that a decision was made and an action was also taken. (Example (b))  【Related Expression】  に決める also means 'decide on' and にする and に決める can be used interchangeably, although に決める is usually used in situations where a decision is considered significant or important.

In general, the choice between が and を seems to depend on the degree of volition expressed in the action the experiencer takes. That is, if his volition is high, を is preferable. Thus, in the following sentences, が is unnatural.  <ul>(2) <li>a. 私はやめようと思えばいつでも今の仕事を/*がやめられる。</li> <li>I can quit my current job whenever I want to quit (literally: whenever I think I will quit it).</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 僕はやっとの思いで自分を/*がおさえられた。</li> <li>I could barely control my emotions (literally: hold myself.)</li> </ul>  3. 出来る 'can do', however, always requires the object of an action to be marked by が, as in Example (b). Another example follows:  <ul>(3) <li>私はチェスが/*を出来る。</li> <li>I can play chess.</li> </ul>  4. The spatial を (i.e., <a href=\"#㊦ を (2)\">を2</a>) and the detachment を (i.e., <a href=\"#㊦ を (3)\">を3</a>) do not change into が in potential expressions.  <ul>(4) Space <li>a. 私はあの公園を/*が夜一人で歩けない。</li> <li>I can't walk through that park by myself at night.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. この道を/*がくつをはかずに歩けますか。</li> <li>Can you walk along this road without shoes on?</li> </ul>  <ul>(5) Detachment <li>今日はうちを/*が出られません。</li> <li>I can't leave home today.</li> </ul>  5. If the experiencer is clear from the context and/or the situation, or if the experiencer is a person in general, he is usually omitted and the object of the action is presented as a topic marked by は, as in Key Sentence (B) and Example (c).  6. Non-volitional verbs like 分かる 'understand, be understandable'; 要る 'need, be necessary'; ある 'exist'; 開く 'open (verb, intransitive)' and 腐る 'rot (verb, intransitive)' do not have potential forms.  7.

In some situations, if the verb in Verbますたい is a transitive verb, the direct object can be marked either by が or by を, as seen in Key Sentence (B), Examples (a) and (b). In general, the choice between が and を seems to depend on the degree of desire. That ist when the desire to do something is high, が is preferred; when it is low, を is used. Compare (4) and (5):   <ul>(4) [Situation: The speaker has just run five miles.] <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>私は水が/?を飲みたい。</li> <li>I want to drink some water.</li> </ul>  <ul>(5) [Situation: The speaker has been told by a doctor to drink as much water as possible.

(For examples, see Key Sentence (A), (C), (D) and Example (f), respectively.)  2. The tense before うちに is always nonpast, regardless of the tense of the main clause.  3. The verb before うちに is frequently negated, as in Key Sentence (B), Examples (a) and (b).  【Related Expressions】  I. When it indicates an interval of time, 間 refers to the 'time space' between two points, i.e., the beginning and the end. In other words, the time space indicated by 間 can be measured in clocktime. うち, however, does not refer to such measurable time space; it simply means 'time space within'. Thus, in a situation where a mother wants to read books while her child is away at school, either うち or 間 can be used, as in [1a]. However, in a situation where we want to play tennis before it rains, we cannot substitute 間 for うち, as in [1b], because it is impossible to specify a time boundary.

If the change is not gradual, なくなる is used in place of ないようになる.  (See Related Expression II.)  2. ようになっている emphasizes a current state that has come about after a long process, as in Example (d).  3. There are two ways to negate this construction, but the meanings are completely different. The verb before ように can be negated, as in (2a), or the verb なる can be negated, as in (2b).  <ul>(2) <li>a. 漢字が覚えられないようになった。</li> <li>I've reached the point where I can't memorize kanji.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. 漢字が覚えられるようにならなかった。</li> <li>I haven't reached the point where I can memorize kanii.</li> </ul>  (2a) means that the speaker can't memorize kanji any more, and (2b) means that he is not yet able to memorize kanji.  4. ように by itself can be used as an adverbial phrase, along with main verbs other than なる.   (⇨ <a href=\"#㊦ ように (1)\">ように1</a>; <a href=\"#㊦ ように (2)\">ように2</a>)  【Related Expressions】  I. ことになる 'it has been decided that ~' and ようになる are related expressions in that both of them indicate some change, but they differ in that the former implies a passive decision, while the latter suggests a change brought about by a long process.

For example, Key Sentence (A) and (B) can be rephrased using 過ぎる, as in[1].

First, あまり is always a part of an adverbial clause or phrase which expresses a cause. 過ぎる, however, does not always express cause and can be in the predicate of a main clause. Second, あまり is used only when the verb or noun represents a psychological action or state. Thus, the following sentences are unacceptable.  [2] <ul> <li>昨日ビールを飲むあまり今日頭が痛い。</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>Yesterday I drank too much beer and I have a headache today.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>Correct Formation: 昨日あまりビールを飲んだ{ので/ために}今日頭が痛い。</li> </ul>  [3]  <ul> <li>*疲れのあまり食欲がない。</li> <li>I am so tired that I have no appetite.</li> </ul>  Third, 過ぎる is used in both spoken and written Japanese while あまり is limited in use to formal written Japanese.

The construction of ば~ほど is very close in meaning to 'the more ~, the more ~' construction in English.  2. Other conditionals たら and と cannot be used in this construction. Thus, the following use of と and たら are ungrammatical.  <ul>(1) <li>授業料は{安ければ/*安いと}安いほどいい。</li> <li>As for the tuition, the cheaper the better.</li> </ul>  <ul>(2) <li>玄米は{かめば/*かんだら}かむほど味が出る。</li> <li>As for brown rice, the more you chew it, the tastier it becomes.</li> </ul>  3. When the verb is a する verb as in Key Sentence (A), it takes the form of either Noun すれば Noun するほど or Noun すればするほど as in Key Sentence (A). If the verb is not a する verb as in Example (a), it always takes the form of Verb conditional Verb informal nonpast ほど.  4. The conditional form なら is used only with Adjective な. So, the following sentences are ungrammatical.  <ul>(3) <li>*この酒は飲むなら飲むほど美味しくなる。 [Correct formation= Example (a)]</li> </ul>  <ul>(4) <li>*アパートは駅に近いなら近いほど(家賃が)高い。 [Correct formation= Example (c)]</li> </ul>","type":"Structure","relatedExpression":["ほど"]},{"﻿title":"~ばかりか~（さえ）","description":"A compound particle/conjunction which is used to connect two nouns or two sentences, the first of which is something normally expected and the second of which is something normally unexpected.","englishEquivalent":"Not only ~ but also","textInfo":"1.

The pnrases ばかりで(は)なく~も and だけで(は)なく~も are very similar to ばかりか~(さえ). Among those three constructions ばかりか~(さえ) expresses the highest degree of unexpectedness between the content of Sentence1 and Sentence2. If such unexpectedness is missing, the ばかりか~(さえ) construction sounds awkward. Examples follow.  [1]  <ul> <li>a. あの人は勉強{だけ/ばかり}で(は)なくスポーツもよく出来る。</li> <li>He is not only good scholastically; he is also good at sports.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ??あの人は勉強ばかりか、スポーツさえ出来る。</li> </ul>  [2]  <ul> <li>a. この本は面白い{だけ/ばかり}で(は)なく、とてもためになる。</li> <li>This book is not only interesting but also educational.</li> <div class=\"divide\"></div> <li>b. ??この本は面白いばかりかためにさえなる。</li> </ul>  (⇨ <a href=\"http://bunpou.neocities.org/基本basic.html#㊦ だけで(は)なく～(も)\">だけで(は)なく~(も)</a>㊦)  II. Sentence1 どころか Sentence2, a construction indicating that someone/something is very far from a/n (un)desirable state, is quite different from Sentence1 ばかりか Sentence2, when Sentence1 is affirmative and Sentence2 is negative or when Sentence1 is negative and Sentence2 is affirmative. Examples follow.  [3]  <ul> <li>日本語が話せる{どころか/*ばかりか}、一度も勉強したことがありません。</li> <li>I am far from being able to speak Japanese; I haven't studied it at all.</li> </ul>  [4]  <ul> <li>スミスさんは日本語が書けない{どころか/*ばかりか}、日本語で小説さえ書ける。</li> <li>Mr. Smith is far from being unable to write Japanese; he can even write a novel in Japanese.</li> </ul>  If both Sentence1 and Sentence2 are affirmative or negative, the two constructions are interchangeable.

[See Key Sentence (E) and Examples (g) - (i).]  3. べきだ usually expresses the idea that someone/something should do something or be in some state because it is his/her responsibility or duty, because it is the right thing or a good thing to do, or because it is the right state or a good state to be in. [See Key Sentence (A) - (E), Examples (a) - (f) and (i).]  4. べきだ also expresses the idea that someone is expected to do s.t. [See Examples (g) and (h).]  5. Adjective い stem+くあるべきだ, as in (1), is a possible form but this form is not commonly used.  <ul>(1) <li>体は年をとっても心は若くあるべきだ。</li> <li>Even if one's body gets old, one's mind should be young.</li> </ul>  6. べきだ is not used when the speaker is younger than the hearer or lower than the hearer in status.
